Meredith: [voiceover] We all remember the bed time stories of our childhoods. The shoe fits Cinderella, the frog turns into a prince, sleeping beauty is awakened with a kiss. Once upon a time and then they lived happily ever after. Fairy tales, the stuff of dreams. The problem is, fairy tales don't come true. It's the other stories, the ones that begin with dark and stormy nights and end in the unspeakable. It's the nightmares that always seem to become reality. The person that invented the phrase "Happily ever after" should have his ass kicked, so hard!

Meredith: [voiceover] In 6500 BC, some guy looked at his sick friend and said "I have an idea, why don't I drill a hole in your skull? It will make you feel better." And thus surgery was born. It takes a certain brand of crazy to come up with an idea like drilling into someone's skull, but surgeons have always been a confident bunch. We usually know what we're doing, and we don't, we still act like we do. We walk boldly into undiscovered country, plant a flag and start ordering people around. It's invigorating and terrifying.

It’s no wonder doctors spend so much time trying to keep the heart stable, to keep it slow, steady, regular to stop the heart from pounding out of your chest from the dread of something terrible or the anticipation of something else entirely.

Meredith: [voiceover] Every patient’s story starts the same way. It starts with them being fine, it starts in the before. They cling to this moment, this memory of being fine, this before, as though talking about it may somehow bring it back. But what they don't realize is that the fact they're talking about it to us, their doctors, means there's no going back. By the time they see us, they're already in the after. And while every patient's story starts the same way, how the story ends depends on us, on how well we diagnose and treat. We know the story hinges on us and we all want to be the hero.

Callie: I never thought I'd end up with a woman, God, but, I mean not until lately, but that's not the problem. The problem is the peds thing.

Callie: Look, I'm sorry about your patient. I know how hard it can be. I, I had a patient a couple of years ago, a young guy, 50 maybe. Simple knee replacement. He was post op, he was fine. I even told his wife she could go and get him lunch. I mean, it was a simple knee replacement, it was nothing. But, ah, he'd been getting short of breath so I'd put him on blood thinners for a post surgical PE. And, ah, It wasn't until he was vomiting up dark red blood, looking me in the eye, telling me that he was dying... that I figured it out. That I was wrong. That it wasn't a PE, he was bleeding internally. It wouldn't have been fatal, but the blood thinners. God, I will never forget the look on his wife's face.

Meredith:  [voiceover] Practicing medicine doesn't lend itself well to the making of friends. Maybe because life and mortality are in our faces all the time. Maybe because in staring down death everyday, we're forced to know that life, every minute, is borrowed time. And each person we let ourselves care about is just one more loss somewhere down the line. For this reason, I know some doctors who just don't bother making friends at all.

And this right here is where Dr. Bailey kicked you out of the surgery because she caught us in your driveway in my car. [both laugh] And right here, this was a seven hour craniotomy and you held the clamp the entire time, never flinched. That's when I knew you were going to be an incredible surgeon. And right here, this is when I supervised you drilling a burr hole for the very first time. I was watching you more than I was watching the drilling, because I knew I'd fallen in love with you. Beth Monroe, made our clinical trial a success by surviving. You talked me into putting her under. That's when I knew I needed you. And this is today. Post op head CT of Izzie Stevens.

Izzie:  Just decide for me. Please?
Alex: You don't have to know right now. Think about it.
Izzie:  I don't have time.

Swinder: The test impaired your memory to such a degree that I have to strongly recommend you don't have the surgery.
Derek: Izzie, the test was the worst case scenario. The result has nothing to do with the surgery.
Swinder: We don't know that.
Derek: But what I do know is that not operating is every bit as risky as the surgery itself. If not more. But, it's up to you.
Izzie: What do you think?
Alex: I think he's talking to you, not me.
Derek: I'll leave you two alone to discuss this.
Alex: Ah, I'll come with you. I have a couple of questions.
Izzie: Wait, Alex.
Alex: Think about what you want to do for a second, OK? I'll be right back. [everyone but Meredith leaves the room. Meredith closes the door]
Meredith:  You are not having the surgery!

Meredith: [voiceover] We spend our whole lives worrying about the future, planning for the future, trying to predict the future, as if figuring it out will somehow cushion the blow. But the future is always changing. The future is the home of our deepest fears and our wildest hopes. But one thing is certain when it finally reveals itself, the future is never the way we imagined it.

Meredith:  [voiceover] Doctors spend a lot of time focused on the future, planning it, working toward it. But at some point you start to realize your life is happening now. Not after med school, not after residency, right now. This is it. It's here. Blink and you'll miss it.

Cristina: She just had brain surgery, and an incredibly aggressive course of IL2. She needs rest. 
Alex: She needs to exercise whatever memory she's got left before it all turns to mush.
Cristina: Well she's not going to heal with you barking orders at her like a caveman. 
Alex: Butt out Yang.
Cristina: You know what she's my patient. I don't care if you’re her husband. 
Alex: Look, she...
Cristina: You wanna see how fast I can get your visiting hours down to zero?
Alex: She signed a DNR. She signed a fricking DNR and made me promise me she'd come out of this with a life, not in a hospital bed, not with no brain. I had to promise she'd have a life. You wanna know what happens if she can't make any new memories? Forget about being a doctor. She's going to need round the clock baby sitters. We get an apartment together, she can't ever find her way to the damn toilet, track her on her ankle in case god forbids, she wanders out the front door!
Cristina: Alex, you can handle this, she will get better.
Alex: Maybe, maybe not. It's on me. Her future is on me.

Meredith: How's she doing? Any better?
Cristina: No.
Meredith: Damn. Well, I'm going to city hall to go do the thing.
Cristina: Seriously? It doesn't seem like the day for it.
Meredith: Look at Alex. He's in there working so hard all day, and she doesn't know. And, if she stays like this she may never know how much he loves her. And that girl Amanda, she's in there loving a stranger. She thinks that's her Prince Charming. I mean, he's probably gonna die today. Chances are. So yeah, I'm gonna go get married, because I think it's important to take the time to tell the people you love how much you love them while they can hear you. I love you Cristina Yang. [smiles]
Cristina: You have changed.
Meredith: Mmmm... Maybe I have. What?
Cristina: I'm gonna hug you.

Derek: Meredith...
Meredith: No, you know let's go, we gotta go. We gotta run to city hall, we'll come back, you'll check on Izzie, we'll monitor John Doe, I'll go talk George out of joining the army! 
Derek: Look, we can do this another day-
Meredith: There is no other day! Everyday is like this, everyday there's a crisis, there's no time. 
Derek: Meredith...
Meredith: I love you and I do want to marry you, today. But there is no time. 
Derek: [Cups her face with his hands] Do you have a piece of paper? 
Meredith: For what?
Derek: I want to be with you forever. And you want to be with me forever. In order to do that, we need to make vows. A commitment. A contract. Give me, a piece of paper. 
Meredith: I don't! I-I-I don't... I have post-its. [Hands him posts-its and a pen. Derek goes and sits on the bench]
Derek: Okay... what do we want to promise each other?
Meredith: That you'll love me, even when you hate me.
Derek: To love each other... even when we hate each other. [writes it down on the post-its] No running. Ever. Nobody walks out. [Meredith joins him on the benches] No matter what happens. 
Meredith: No running. 
Derek: What else?
Meredith: That we'll take care of each other even when we're old and smelly and senile. And... if I get Alzheimer's and I forget you...
Derek: I will you remind you who I am, every day. [They smile at each other] To take care when old, senile, smelly. This is forever. [Derek finishes writing on the post-it, then gives it and the pen to Meredith] Sign. 
Meredith: This is our wedding? A post-it? 
Derek: Mhmm. Well, if you sign it. [Meredith signs it happily and then hands it back to Derek] 
Meredith: Now what?
Derek: Now, I kiss the bride. [He kisses her tenderly. Meredith's smiling as they kiss. Then Derek slowly pulls back]
Meredith: Married.
Derek: Married. [Derek puts the post-it note with their vows and signatures on the back of her cubby, then turns to her] You see that? Plenty of time.
