:Excerpt from a college criminology class syllabus:
Neal: Forger
:A new breed of forger, technological virtuoso with a classical artistic foundation. Suspected of art forgery, theft of the Antioch manuscripts, and convicted of bond forgery. Caffrey was suspected of hundreds of thefts before Agent Burke of the FBI apprehended him. His highly sophisticated schemes made it difficult for the FBI to follow his trail, along with his mastery of the arts made many of his crimes go unnoticed for many years, long after the trail was cold.
:He had a few accomplices, none on record, most of the time choosing to work alone, keeping the number of people that could turn on him to near zero. It is estimated that he forged over 10.3 billion dollars of priceless antiquities. Never the wiser, the FBI pursued him for six years and finally caught him.

Board Member: Yes. At the trial where he was convicted of forgery? 
Sara: Yes. And I went after him with everything I had. I called him a liar and a thief and probably a sociopath, and I meant every word of it.

Neal: “I’m happy here. You know, someone once told me, my life is a dream with an anklet attached. If I wake up tomorrow and that anklet is still on, I have a good job, a wonderful home, a partner and a best friend. A family. But to wake up and answer only to myself. That would mean everything.”

Holloman [member of the board for Neal's commutation hearing]: You caught him [Neal]?
Peter:  Twice. And you should know, the last time I caught him, he was sitting alone in an empty apartment. He had nothing. No one.
Holloman: And now?
Peter:  He has a life. A real life here. One that keeps him grounded and decent. As you've heard, there are many people who care about Neal, people who see him as more than just a criminal. He's frustrating, I'll admit. He drives me crazy on his best days. I don't always have to know where Neal is or what he's up to. But I do know that he has a good heart and a set of principles that weren't there six years ago when he was just another case file that got dropped on my desk.

Holloman: Do you think Mr. Caffrey has been reformed?

[Excerpt from a video Ellen Parker, former police partner of Neal's father, made 30 years earlier, when Neal was three years old.]
Ellen Parker: By now, I assume you know, your father’s been accused of a very serious crime. He told me he was innocent and I believed him. I worked with him a long time. He’s no killer, Neal. The man I know can’t be. After he was arrested, your dad told me that our department is filled with dirty cops and they set him up. So I’ve spent the last few months running down leads, trying to back up his story, and he’s right about one thing: there are dirty cops, a lot of them. But did they set him up? I—I thought maybe they had. And then, uh, yesterday, your father confessed to the murder. I tried to talk to him, but all anyone will tell me is that he turned state’s evidence and that you, your mom, and I are being placed into witness protection.

[Neal asks the person he believes to be Samuel Phelps, an undercover cop, about his father.]

One day, he brought you down to the precinct and he introduced you around as a junior detective to every cop in the house. I mean, you just loved that. And then, I remember, at some point, you drifted away. Man, did he panic. He had about ten detectives looking for you. We finally found you in the captain’s office, wearing his hat. I guess you always had a thing for hats.
Neal: I don’t remember that.
