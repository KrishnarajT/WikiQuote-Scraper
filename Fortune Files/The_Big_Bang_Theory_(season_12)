Sheldon: Good morning, wife.
Amy: Good morning, husband. I can't believe we're actually married.
Sheldon: It's official. According to tradition we should hang the bed sheets outside so the Villagers can see that we consummated. [makes his way over to the curtains]
Amy: I don't think that's appropriate considering where we're starting our Honeymoon.
Sheldon: Well, I suppose you're right... [opens the curtains, revealing Legoland California outside] Although when you think about it, Lego is the perfect metaphor for marital congress; two pieces that interlock together with a satisfying snap.
Amy: Oh, that's the sound you were making.
Sheldon: Oh, I almost forgot. While you were sleeping I ordered room service.
Amy: Really?!
Sheldon: [lifts the lid off the plate, revealing bacon, eggs, and pancakes made out of Legos.] Viola! You thought it was going to be food, didn't you?

Sheldon: I'm just worried that if I don't schedule our bedroom endeavors, then I may not think about them, and you'll grow cold and distant and seek solace in the arms of a heavily-muscled long Shore man.
Amy: Where would I find a long Shore man?
Sheldon: Along the Shore. It's in the name.
Amy: Sheldon, I couldn't be with anybody but you.
Sheldon: That's good to know. I wouldn't want to have to fight a man who's brave enough to touch a fish.
Amy: How's this for a compromise; make all the schedules you want. Just don't tell me about them.
Sheldon: Excellent. I'll create an algorithm that'll generate a pseudo-random schedule. And do you know why it won't be a true random schedule?
Amy: Because the generation of true random numbers remains an unsolved problem in computer science.
Sheldon: Come with me.
Amy: Where are we going?
Sheldon: To the hotel room. And when we get there I'm gonna need you to say that again, except naked.

George Sr.: But we're not gonna quit, either. And if we do lose, you need to know that doesn't make you losers. You learn as much about who you are and what you're made of from failing as you do from success. Maybe more.
