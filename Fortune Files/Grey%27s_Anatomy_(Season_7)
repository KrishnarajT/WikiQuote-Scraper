We may look the same, we probably do, the change isn't visible at least not in most of us, but we are all changed completely forever.

Lexie: I read a book. About the history of mass murders in the US. You know, that's the actual name of what happened to us, it was a mass murder. You can't call it a terriost attack because the murders weren't political in nature. And we weren't the victims of a serial killer because Mr. Clark would have had to had murdered several people in a period longer than 30 days to qualify as a serial killer. We-- We could call it a spree killing which is defined as killings in two more locations with no break or pause in between 'cause Mr. Clark shot that guy in his car before he got here. But I-I'm not sure that, that counts as a true second location since it was so close to the hospital. Which means that we were a mass murder. Because it happened at one place, by one person, and more than four people were killed.

Meredith: [voiceover] When we say things like "People don't change" it drives scientists crazy. Because change is literally the only constant in all of science. Energy, matter, it's always changing. Morphing. Merging. Growing. Dying. It's the way people try not to change that's unnatural. The way we cling to what things were instead of letting them be what they are. The way we cling to old memories instead of forming new ones. The way we insist on believing, despite every scientific indication, that anything in this lifetime is permanent. Change is constant. How we experience change, that's up to us. It can feel like death, or it can feel like a second chance at life. If we open our fingers, loosen our grips, go with it, it can feel like pure adrenaline. Like at any moment we can have another chance at life. Like at any moment, we can be born all over again.

Amelia: I remember, I was trying to get to him but… I couldn't move.

Prayed to God that you would be quiet and wouldn't say anything. You were so little. I think that's what I've always wanted all this year, you just to stay… little and quiet and safe.

Meredith [voiceover] Doctors practice deception all the time. We give vague answers to hard questions. We don't talk about post-op pain. We say you'll experience some discomfort. If you didn't die, we tell you that surgery went well. But the placebo has to be the doctor's greatest deception. Half of our patients we tell the truth, the other half, we pray that the placebo effect is real. And we tell ourselves that they'll feel better anyhow. Believing help is on the way, when in fact, we're leaving them to die.

Arizona: [to Callie] Shut up. Just shut up. You don't get to tell me that we're not together. We are together. Because I love you and you love me, and none of the rest of it matters. We are together. And if you ever sleep with anyone else again, man or woman, I will kick the crap out of you. Now you sit your ass back down there because that's my baby in there. I don't want anything happening to my baby.
Callie: [smiling] Your baby, huh?
Arizona: [smiles back] Our baby.

Meredith [voiceover] Doctors practice deception every day. On our patients, on their families… But the worst deception we practice is on ourselves. Which is why sometimes it takes us a while to realize that the truth has been in front of us the whole time.

Mark: Well, what did Arizona say?
Callie: She said she's in.
Mark: Well, that's good, right?
Callie: Eh, I'm still hedging my bets. I'm not gonna move back in with her until I know for sure she's not gonnna bail again.
Lexie: [walks up]  Hey, you got dinner plans tonight?
Mark: No.
Lexie: I'm cooking for you tonight, your place. I rocked the lab coli. [kisses him and walks off]
Callie: So when you gonna tell her?
Mark: Not until after my home cooked meal.
Callie: Mark, you do not have to do this. I'm giving you a get out of jail free card, no hard feelings, you can be the cool uncle who hangs out on Sundays.
Mark: I'm not the cool uncle. I'm the dad.
Callie: You love Lexie. And the last time a Sloan kid appeared in Seattle she dumped you. Now, if you were the cool uncle...
Mark: I'm not the cool uncle! Don't ever say that again. This is my kid. I want this kid. [mutters] Cool uncle.

Meredith: [voiceover] One of the hardest lessons as a doctor is learning to prioritize. We're trained to do all we can to save life and limb, but, if cutting off a limb, means saving a life, we learn to do it without hesitation. It's not an easy lesson to learn, and it always comes down to one question, "what are the stakes?" What do we stand to gain or lose? At the end of the day, we're just gamblers trying not to bet the farm.

Callie: Oh, I'm not done. If we're gonna do this whole everybody gets a vote thing, there's gonna be a new system. We'll still each get one vote, but also, the baby gets a vote. As I house the baby, I'll be speaking for him/her. And, since I'll be pushing this baby out of a very small hole in my body, I'll also get an extra special vagina vote! So, that's uh, three votes for us, two votes for you guys. Oh! We get the final say! Now, I'll be using my many votes to say that once a day, I will have one cup of regular coffee every day which is perfectly fine according to the studies that I've read. At least until I begin breastfeeding. Now, anybody wanna argue with my extra special vagina vote?

Meredith: [voiceover] How much can you actually accomplish in an hour? Run an errand maybe, sit in traffic, get an oil change. When you think about it an hour isn't very long. Sixty minutes. Thirty-six hundred seconds. That's it. In medicine, though, an hour is often everything. We call it the golden hour. That magical window of time that can determine whether a patient lives or dies.

Meredith: [voiceover] An hour, one hour, can change everything forever. An hour can save your life. An hour can change your life. Sometimes an hour is a gift we give ourselves.

Thirty-six hundred seconds. That's it. Then it starts all over again. And who knows what the next hour might hold.

We did that all day at the hospital. When it comes to ourselves, we've got nothing left. And is it worth it—being responsible? Because if you take your vitamins and pay your taxes and never cut the line, the universe still gives you people to love and then lets them slip through your fingers like water, and then what have you got?

Callie: Look, I am doing my best here to make sure that you are happy, and that Mark is happy and that the tiny person growing inside me is happy. I don't know what else I can do to be honest. Please tell me. Cause I'll do it. Whatever will make you happy, I will do it.

So you're suddenly surrounded by people, doctors, nurses, specialists, technicians; surgery is a team sport. Everyone pushing for the finish line. Putting you back together again. But surgery is a trauma in and of itself, and once it's over, the real healing begins. It's called recovery. Recovery is not a team sport. It's a solitary distance run. It's long. It's exhausting.

You have to fight your competition, fend off their attacks. And sometimes, you have to kill.  You do what you need to do to survive. Adapt or die. As many times as we've heard it, the lesson doesn't get easier. The problem is, we're human… we want more than just to survive. We want love. We want success. We want to be the best that we can be.
