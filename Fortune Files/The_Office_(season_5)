Kelly: I swallowed a tapeworm last night. It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat. And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it. Creed sold it to me. It's from Mexico.

Creed: That wasn't a tapeworm.
Ryan: Kelly.
Kelly: Oh, hello Ryan. You look well.
Ryan: I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years. I was in my mid twenties and I was going through a lot of stuff. I think I never fully processed 9/11.
Michael: Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
Jim: I would like to lose 65 pounds.
Michael: Yes, all right. Who else? [to Angela] Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
Angela: No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
Michael: If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
Jim: Cryogenics. Beer me five.
Michael: This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
Meredith: [About Kelly] I like her nails.
Michael: Okay, be more specific.
Meredith: I like her finger nails.

Michael: I love babies.  I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.  It feeds my soul.  Babies are drawn to me.  And I think it's because they see me as one of them.  But... cooler and with my life put together a little bit more.  If a baby were President, there would be no taxes.  There would be no war.  There would be no... government, and... things could get terrible.  And actually probably it would be a better screenplay idea then a serious suggestion.
Jim: Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through...  delusion.
Stanley: I do not like pregnant women in my workspace. They always complain. I have varicose veins, too. I have swollen ankles. I'm constantly hungry. Do you think my nipples don't get sore, too? Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?

She tells me to stop.  It’s her father’s business; she’s Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come, and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada – I don’t trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.   Thirty years later, I get a postcard: I have a son, and he’s the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting.  I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadéro.  She’s been waiting for me all these years, she’s never taken another lover.  I don’t care.  I don’t show up. I go to Berlin.  That’s where I stashed the chandelier.
