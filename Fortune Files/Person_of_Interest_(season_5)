Harold Finch [Finch is at a wedding, with the pretense of being an estranged uncle from Ireland.

Will O'Brien [the groom says to the audience] Just being modest, Uncle Ralph!
Harold Finch Uh...
Will O'Brien A little liquid courage will cure that. [Pushes a glass of liquor into Finch's hand]' Don't be nervous, just sing, whatever comes to mind.
Harold Finch Good lad. Cheers. [Finch downs the whole glass. Long silence. The audience looks on] Um.. [Approaches the mic. Long silence. He haltingly starts to speak lyrics, with the cadence of an Irish protest song - the actual song's original melody is unrecognizable] We've got the right to choose it. / And / there ain't no way we'll lose it. / This is our life, this is our song. // We'll fight the powers that be, just / don't pick our destiny, 'cause / you don't know us.

Harold Finch He is now, no thanks to you.
Carl Elias Perhaps if you had told me about my friend Bruce's death, I wouldn't have had to resort to other sources.
Harold Finch I didn't tell you because I was afraid you would seek retribution. There are powerful forces in play.
Carl Elias You don't have to tell me, Harold. I have a scar on my chest to prove it. But a little advice: a leader enlists all his resources in war, not just his favourites.
Harold Finch This is a battle best fought alone. John and I can handle it, and I'd appreciate it in the future if you would leave Detective Fusco out of this.
Carl Elias Some time ago, you gave me a book, advice for these troubled times. I would like to return the favour. War requires sacrifices.
Harold Finch I'll bear that in mind.
Carl Elias You know what your problem is, Harold? 
Harold Finch No, tell me.

Harold Finch I have played by the rules for so long.
FBI SAIC Roberts Not from where I'm sitting.
Harold Finch No. Not your rules. You work at the behest of a system so broken that you didn't even notice when it became corrupted at its core. When I first broke your rules, a sitting president had authorized assassination squads in Laos, and the head of the FBI had ordered his men... you... to conduct illegal surveillance on his political rivals. Your rules have changed every time it was convenient for you. I was talking about my rules. I have lived by those rules for so long. Believed in them for so long. Believed that if you played by the right rules, eventually you would win. But I was wrong, wasn't I? And now all the people I cared about are dead. Or will be dead soon enough. And we will be gone without a trace. So now I have to decide. Decide whether to let my friends die, to let hope die, to let the world be ground under your heel all because I played by my rules. I'm trying to decide. I'm going to kill you. But I need to decide how far I'm willing to go... how many of my own rules I'm willing to break to get it done.
FBI SAIC Roberts Look, you want to add threatening the life of a federal agent to your file, I will draw up those charges right now. No waiting is required.

Root  Anyway, Schrodinger said, at its base level the universe isn't made up of physical matter but just shapes... A shape, you know? Nothing firm. What it means is the real world is essentially a simulation anyway... I liked that idea. That even if we're not real, we represent a dynamic. A tiny finger tracing a line in the infinite: a shape. And then we're gone... Listen, all I'm saying is that, if we're just information--just noise in the system--we might as well be a symphony.
