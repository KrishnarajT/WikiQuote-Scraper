Booth: I do not like cats.
Sweets: Well, that's consistent with the person you were before your brain surgery.
Booth: I don't own a nightclub, I'm not married to Bones, you are not a singing bartender and I hate clowns. So, can I go back to work now?
Sweets: When our sense of reality is challenged - you know - really challenged, it can take some time to regain our footing.
Booth: Look, it's been six weeks since I put my brain box through the blender, there. I am back, baby, huh! Special Agent Seeley Joseph Booth!

Avalon: This man was lost. You brought him the light that showed him the way home. Without it he would have died.
Angela: Booth was in a coma. Brennan read him the book that she was writing. When Booth woke up he thought that they had a whole different life together, he thought that they were married. He thought that for days.
Avalon: You were joined at that time. You're still joined.
[[w:Temperance "Bones" Brennan|Brennan: [Getting up to leave.] Nothing either of you is saying makes sense.
Avalon: [Turns over another card] Were you pregnant?
Brennan: [Dismissively] What? No, of course not.
Avalon: I mean in your book.
Brennan: [Stares, surprised, for a moment] No, I deleted the book. I'm tired, Angela, I'm going to go check in at the office and then go home. Nice to meet you, Miss Harmonia. [Leaves]
Angela: [About Brennan] Underneath the icy exterior beats a very warm heart.
Avalon: Her life is at a very critical turning point. Between great happiness - [She turns over a card.]

Cam: [Bluntly] You're in love with Dr. Brennan.
[Booth is shocked, Cam just smiles gently.]
Booth: [After a pause] What I'm wondering is, am I the same guy?
Cam: A sweet, kick-ass FBI murder solver with hard fists and a lion heart? Mmm, yep, you're still him. My advice, for what it's worth, forget the bruised brain and go with your lion heart.
Booth:  Right, right, yeah, and tell Bones how I feel.

Sweets: Do you know what you're looking at?
Booth: Yeah, and I'm pretty sure you haven't been this close to one in a long time.
Sweets: It's a PET scan of your brain.
Booth: Hmm. Then I was wrong.
Sweets: This is called the ventral tegmental area, and this is the dorsal caudate body. Now these two areas have been proven to be linked to romantic love and sexual arousal. 
Booth: Okay, if this is your version of dirty pictures, they're not working for me right now. [Closes the laptop computer.]
Sweets: No. [Reopens computer] This, uh, this scan was taken before your operation. The green and blue colors indicate very low activity. The same scan while you were in the coma: lit up like the fourth of July. You were dreaming of being in love, of being married, right? [changes image] The same scan, three days ago. Before your operation you were not in love. After your operation you were. Conclusion: your feelings are not real and will fade away, like every other symptom of your coma. Now, I think you and I both know that Dr. Brennan's hyper-rationale is really just a cover for a very vulnerable and sensitive core.
Booth: Oh, great. So we're talking about Bones' brain, too, here now.

Avalon: No, I'm here looking for clues. Something I might have missed.
Brennan: In your cards? Because that is a waste of time.
Avalon: You say that after I sent Agent Booth to save your life.
Brennan: Well, you knew where the bodies were buried. You knew Dr. Leacock would attack me. 
Avalon: [turns over a card] You were an abandoned child. [turns over another card] The world scares you, so you wrap it up neatly in bonds of reason, education and proof. All riddles are solvable to you, except for one. 
Brennan: Yes, the riddle of how you knew where your sister was buried.
Avalon: No. The riddle you can't solve is how somebody could love you.
Brennan: [laughs dismissively] Well, I'm beautiful and very intelligent.

Owen Thiel: A man died this week. By all accounts, he was a... good man. Loved his mother. Worked hard. Shouldered his responsibilities. Man that any one of us would be proud to call a friend. I killed him with this microphone. I killed him by going on these airwaves and sharing my rage with you, spreading my rage. Now, you can say it wasn't my fault. It was a coincidence. I thought about that. Thought about it a lot, but the fact is—the fact is that if it weren't for me, he might still be alive. I'm so sorry for that. And I remembered something that I forgot over the last few years. That God is not only a god of anger and vengeance. My religious beliefs tell me that Christ did not die in vain. That He died to redeem us all. And I intend to show that this good, simple man also did not die in vain. That he redeemed one angry, shouting man. So these are the last words I will ever broadcast. I hope that they're the words you remember best. Peace on Earth.

Booth Why?
Hacker Vladov the Impaler? The nickname is self-explanatory.
Booth Nah, I can handle it.
Hacker Good. But I truly hope that you don't end up getting eaten by sharks because your successes have done wonders for my career.

Booth: No. No. Uh, let's -- you think, we can go twenty minutes on this case without talking about testicles?
Sweets: Please.
[[w:Temperance "Bones" Brennan|Brennan: Okay.
Booth: Great.
Brennan: Booth has made a social contract with a marine biologist.
Sweets: Sorry?
Booth:  [laughing] It's amazing that you go from injured testicles to the woman I'm dating. [turning to Sweets] And you, you're supposed to say, "Oh, that's interesting," in a very annoying way.
Brennan: It was a logical transition.
Sweets: But it is very interesting.
Brennan: Booth and I are friends. Catherine is an intelligent, attractive woman, and I'm intrigued by their developing relationship.
Booth: That's nice. I think.
Sweets: Yeah. I think it is nice.
Booth: Thank you, Bones.
Sweets: Wow. You two seem to be handling dating very well. I'm impressed.
Brennan: Well, you've known me for two years, Sweets. You should expect to be impressed by me.

Brennan: Booth seems to like Catherine, don't you think?
Cam: I do. I'm glad. It's been a long time since he dated anyone.
Brennan: I know. It's important for Booth to share his life. I prefer being alone.
Cam: But you're seeing Hacker.
Brennan: Yes, I like him. But not like Booth. I mean, not like Booth wants to like someone.
Cam: All organisms evolve and develop along patterns only recognized in retrospect. Your life doesn't exist outside the laws of nature.
Brennan: Then in ignorance, I await my own surprise. Although the odds of it to involving a commitment to another person are remote.

Booth We have some unanswered questions about [[Kurt Cobain's death and thought maybe you can give us some insight.
Bebe [jumps up in excitement] Seriously?
[Booth grins and takes out his handcuffs]
Brennan I believe he was being ironic but if you do have information about this Cobain person I'm sure the FBI would appreciate that too.
Booth [stares at Brennan] Thanks Bones.

Brennan: I have the sense that everything's changing, Booth. 
Booth: Not everything. Look, we're still partners, right? And Taffet, she's put away. I mean, you're feeling good about that, right?
Brennan: You almost died, Booth. That could happen again. What if next time I can't get to you?
Booth: It's not going to happen again.
Brennan: I envy your ability to substitute optimism for reality.
Booth: You know what? Maybe you just need to take some time off. Go to a beach. Lay in the sun. 
Brennan: I might need more than a little time.
Booth: [shakes his head] Don't make any decisions about your future right now.
Brennan: I'm just saying --
Booth: You know when a dentist gives you anesthetic and tells you not to operate any heavy machinery or make any important decisions within twenty-four hours? All right, this case was bigger than a root canal. Come on, let's just go back inside and have one more drink. Come on, just one. [takes her hand and tries to pull her inside] 
Brennan: No, I'm tired, Booth. I'm going to go home. [hails a cab]
Booth: All right. Come on, let's get you in the cab. I know, it's been a long long day. [Brennan gets in the cab] All right? Hey, I'll see you tomorrow, right?

[[w:Temperance "Bones" Brennan|Brennan: The term garbage is relative. The only intrinsic value things have is what we give them. It seems odd now, but in Holland tulip bulbs were once as valuable as houses. Maybe we all overvalue things that are essentially worthless.
Angela: Well that was more than a comment on this case. What's going on, Brennan?
Brennan: What separates what I do here from what this man did?
Angela: So, going to Malulu is worth more?
Brennan: Maluku. Yes. The murders will never stop, but this find has real finite value. I'd be able to answer questions about our origin! Evolutionary tract! It has implications for history, science!
Angela: Listen, you're allowed to make life changes without picking a fight with your old life.
Brennan: But I need a break from that life. I'm worried all the time. Worried that Booth might get hurt on a case and I couldn't prevent it. Worried about what our partnership means. 
Angela: So you want to get away from Booth?
Brennan: No, it's just -- I just need some perspective so that I can view my life with some objectivity.
Angela: Have you talked to him about it?
Brennan: The army wants Booth to go to Afghanistan to train soldiers in the apprehension of terrorists. 
Angela: Is... is he going to go?
Brennan: Even though he said that he wasn't, it felt like he wanted to. Perhaps it's all for the best.
Angela: [scoffs] You two at opposite ends of the world? I don't think so.

Parker: Dad?
Booth: Yeah?
Parker: Are you going back to be a soldier?
Booth: Uh, why are you asking me that?
Parker: Mom said the Army called our house, looking for you.
Booth: I'm not in the Army anymore, Bub. I'm out, okay? I made a decision to stay with the FBI to be with you all the time.
Parker: So... it's my fault?
Booth: What's your fault?
Parker: It's my fault people will die?
Booth: No. That's-that's not what I meant.
Parker: I want you to save lives.
Booth: Yeah, well I do that here.
Parker: No, here you catch people that kill other people. There you would make it so people won't die. Isn't that better?
Booth: It was just a phone call, buddy. That's all. It's over with, alright? I've got an even better idea. What do you say we go get one of those huge, giant, root beer floats that you love so much, huh?

Brennan: Agent Booth and I are partners, I have to discuss it with him first.

Daisy: Lance said that Booth has the psyche of a true warrior, that it's a miracle he hasn’t gone back long before this. Maybe you’re holding him back the same way he’s holding you back... I should not have said that... but sometimes my mouth just has a mouth of its own.

Brennan: I'll only be gone for a year.
Booth: Me too. So, hey, what’s a year?
Brennan: It’s the time it takes the Earth to make a full revolution around the sun.
Booth: In the scheme of things. You know, the grand scheme. I’m just saying a year, you know, it’s not too bad.
Brennan: Right.
Booth: Right?
Brennan: We can come back, pick up where we left off. Nothing really has to change
Booth: No, things have to change. You know what? Hey, I taught you about eye contact, you taught me about evolution. So... here’s to change.
Brennan: To change.
