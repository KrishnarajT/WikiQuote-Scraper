Eli Loker: You did?
Cal Lightman: Yeah. Yeah, I’ve known that all along.

Cal Lightman: No, no I was testing Torres.
Eli Loker: Why?
Cal Lightman: I could tell she knew what you’d done, I mean, there’s no surprise there, but we have a lot of secrets here, so I wanted to see if she could keep one under pressure.
Eli Loker: Are you gonna fire her for not turning me in?
Cal Lightman: No, I would have fired her if she had. Loyalty is crucial here. But you, on the other hand. What you did is inexcusable, and involving her is selfish, disrespectful, and just plain stupid. 
Eli Loker: I’ll empty my office.
