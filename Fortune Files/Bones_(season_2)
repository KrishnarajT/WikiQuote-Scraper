Hodgins [rhetorically] Why does everyone think my job is so easy?
Cam [looks at the body] Wow, you weren't kidding. Twirl her around, we can pretend we're at a {{w|rave}}. What's the good word, Hodgins?
Hodgins [protests] Hey! I am not a party trick!

Brennan Dad, what are you doing here?
Max Well, I heard you were getting married.
Brennan What? No! Angela's getting married to Hodgins, not me.
Max Oh...uh, the bug guy... oh that's great! [Booth starts to handcuff him]
Booth [to Max] Will you shut up, please! [catches Brennan looking at him, awkwardly to her] Uh, long enough for me to Mirandize him.
Max [sarcastically] You got the right to remain silent....got it! [to Brennan] We'll talk more later.
Booth [apologetically] Look, I'm sorry, Bones, but he killed the Deputy Director of the FBI. I'm just doing my job.

Angela: Hey Brennan, I'd like to ask you a favor. Well, it's not so much ask a favor as, as, as extend an honor. I mean, I hope you see it as an honor and you don't think of it as some onerous duty, which I don't think you will, but then again I've never done this before, and of course—
Brennan: Angela, just ask.
Angela: Will you be my maid of honor? [Brennan looks close to tears] At the wedding? [Brennan hugs her] Is that yes?
Brennan: I'm completely, totally honored.
Angela: Really? I thought I'd have to tell you what a maid of honor—
Brennan: I don't even care how awful the bridesmaids' dresses are. I'm so glad you asked me.

Cynthia: Could you please take down the pictures Chelsea drew? I don't want anyone to come in and just throw them away.

Billy [after Hodgins asks for his permission to marry Angela] You're making a huge mistake, son. 
Hodgins Marrying Angela?
Billy No. If Angie finds out that a man – you – asked another man – me – for her hand or any of her other fine parts, horrible complications will ensue. 
Hodgins I didn't think of that.
Billy You could get us both killed.
Hodgins Ok...good advice. [he and Billy shake hands] You got anymore?
Billy Always play it in the key of G demolished.

Ruth Keenan: Hi Temperance, it's Mom. I don't know when or if you'll ever see this, but I hope to put it in your hands myself and see you again with my own eyes. But this is a hard, hard world. Your father and I left you and Russ to save your lives. People would have killed you to get us. That's not what this is about. Today is your sixteenth birthday. I'm so sorry not to be there to tell you all the things a mother should tell her daughter when she turns sixteen, and sorry not to give you this. [holds up the ring Brennan's father gave her] It's an heirloom from my side of the family and starting today, it's yours. I don't know how long it will take me to get it to you, but I promise you I will. You're going to hear a lot of things about your parents, especially about your father. He is a good man. It was my insistence to leave you kids. Max would have kept us together, fought until the end. I'm not sure he'll ever forgive me for that. So please, Temperance, I need you to forgive me. And if you can't forgive me, I beg you, honey, forgive your father, because he is a very good man. Remember this, you were cherished in this world, adored. What I did to you may have been wrong, but I did it out of love. I did it out of love.
