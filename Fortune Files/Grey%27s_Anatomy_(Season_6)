Meredith: [voiceover] According to [[w:Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, when we are dying or have suffered a catastrophic loss, we all move through five distinct stages of grief. We go into denial because the loss is so unthinkable we can't imagine it's true. We become angry with everyone, angry with survivors, angry with ourselves. Then we bargain. We beg. We plead. We offer everything we have, we offer up our souls in exchange for just one more day. When the bargaining has failed and the anger is too hard to maintain, we fall into depression, despair, until finally we have to accept that we have done everything we can. We let go. We let go and move into acceptance.

Meredith: [voiceover] The dictionary defines grief as keen mental suffering or distress over affliction or loss; sharp sorrow; painful regret. As surgeons, as scientists, we're taught to learn from and rely on books, on definitions, on definitives. But in life, strict definitions rarely apply. In life, grief can look like a lot of things that bear little resemblance to sharp sorrow.

Arizona: [to Mr. Torres] Most people think that I was named for the state, but it's not true, I was named for a battle ship. The USS Arizona. My grandfather was serving on the Arizona when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and he saved nineteen men before he drowned. Pretty much everything my father did his whole life was about honoring that sacrifice. I was raised to be a good man in a storm, raised to love my country, love my family, protect the things I love. When my father, Colonel Daniel Robbins of the {{w|United States Marine Corps}}, heard that I was a lesbian he said he only had one question. I was prepared for "How fast can you get the hell out of my house?" But instead, it was "Are you still who I raised you to be?" My father believes in country the way that you believe in God. And my father is not a man who bends, but he bent for me because I am his daughter. I'm a good man in a storm. I love your daughter. And I protect the things I love. Not that I need to; she doesn't need it. She's strong, and caring, and honorable. And she's who you raised her to be.

We uncover new information, trying to get to what's actually wrong. We're asked for second opinions, hoping we'll see something others might have missed.

No, definitely because I grew up in a house with four sisters because it was the quiet that drew me to surgery. The operating room is a quiet place. Peaceful. It has to be in order for us to stay alert, anticipate complications. When you stand in the OR, your patient open on the table, all the world's noise, all the worry that it brings disappears.

Meredith: [voiceover] Everyday we get to give the gift of life, it can be painful, it can be terrifying, but in the end it's worth it. Every time. We all have the opportunity to give. Maybe the gifts are not as dramatic as what happens in the operating room, maybe the gift is to try and make a simple apology, maybe it's to understand another person’s point of view, maybe it's to hold a secret for a friend. The joy supposedly is in the giving, so when the joy is gone, when the giving starts to feel more like a burden, that's when you stop. But if you're like most people I know, you give till it hurts, and then you give some more.

Meredith: [voiceover] We assume the really serious changes in our lives happen slowly, over time. But it's not true. The big stuff happens in an instant. Becoming an adult. Becoming a parent. Becoming a doctor. One minute, you're not, and the next... you are. Ask any doctor, and they can point to the one moment they become a physician. It usually isn't med school graduation day. Whatever it is... nobody forgets it. Sometimes you don't even know anything's changed. You think you're still you and your life is still your life but you wake up one day and you look around and you don't recognize anything. Not anything at all.

Lexie: Are 23 calling me a dirty mistress?
Meredith: That was two years ago and his wife didn't have cancer!
Lexie: Because I've been with like six guys in my whole life. Alex and I, we've done it before. I was recycling, it was like good for the environment.
Alex: Izzie's gone. I was horny. She was there.

Meredith: [voiceover] In surgery, the healing process begins with a cut, an incision, the tearing of flesh. We have to damage the healthy flesh in order to expose the unhealthy. It feels cruel and against common sense, but it works. You risk exposure for the sake of healing, and when it's over, once the incision has been closed, you wait. You wait and you hope that your patient will heal. That you haven't in fact, just made everything worse.

Derek: [voiceover] We ask a lot of our patients. We put them to sleep. Cut them open. Poke around in their brains and guts with sharp instruments.  We ask for their blind trust. Irony is, trust is hard for surgeons, because we're trained from day one that we can't trust anyone but ourselves. The only instincts you can count on are your own. The only skills you can count on are your own. Until one day, you'll leave the classroom and step into the O.R. You're surrounded by others, a team of others. A team that you have to rely on whether you trust them or not.

Cristina: [to Owen] Burke. Burke was- He took something from me. He took little pieces of me, little pieces over time, so small I didn't even notice, you know? He wanted me to be something I wasn't, and I made myself into what he wanted. One day I was me Cristina Yang, and then suddenly I was lying for him, and jeopardizing my career, and agreeing to be married and wearing a ring, and being a bride. Until I was standing there in a wedding dress with no eyebrows, and I wasn't Cristina Yang anymore. And even then, I would've married him. I would have. I lost myself for a long time. And now that I'm finally me again, I can't. I love you. I love you more than I loved Burke. I love you.

I am neither pro nor anti merger. From this point on, everyone has a clean slate. I am not focused on the past. I'm looking to the future to all the promise this hospital has to offer.

Meredith: [voiceover] The surgical scalpel is made of sterilized, carbonized stainless steel. This is a vast improvement over the first scalpel, which was pretty much a sharp stick. Medicine is constantly reinventing itself, that means surgeons have to keep reinventing themselves too. There's constant pressure to adapt to changes. It can be a painful process.

Lexie: Nothing.
Jackson: I'm pretty.
Lexie: What?
Jackson: In my family I'm the pretty one. You know, my eyes, and my smile and my body. I meam, you should see me without shirt on, it's kind of ridiculous. But my family is smart, driven, crazy overachievers. You know? And they look like they're smart. They don't look like me. Which has its perks, except that my family treated me like I'm pretty. They expected nothing from me. Ever. They never pushed me, never thought to. So I had to push myself. Hard. I didn't even tell them I was taking the MCAT's until after I aced them.

I will give to my teachers the respect and gratitude that is their due. I will practice my profession with conscience and dignity. The health of my patients will be my number one consideration. I will respect the secrets that are confided in me, even after my patient has died. [voiceover] I will maintain by all the means in my power, the honor and the noble traditions of the medical profession. My colleagues will be my sisters and brothers. I will not permit considerations of age, disease or disability, creed, ethnic origin, gender, race, political affiliation, nationality, sexual orientation, social standing or any other factor to intervene between my duty and my patient. I will maintain the utmost respect for human life. I will not use my medical knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties, even under threat. I make these promises solemnly, freely and upon my honor.

It's the accidents that always turn out to be the most interesting parts of our day, of life, the people we never expected to show up, a turn of events we never would have chosen for ourselves.

Meredith: Do you wanna talk about it?
Cristina: No.
Meredith: Owen I mean.
Cristina: I know what you mean. I don't want to... I can't... It's just... He doesn't know, who he loves and if it's not me then... I don't want to talk about it. Let's talk about something else.  
Meredith: Okay. You realize you're about to be a godmother.
Cristina: I'm godmother? Okay, what do I have to do? Talk god to the fetus? 'Cause I’m not gonna do that.
Meredith: It means, you take care of the kid if I die. 
Cristina: Derek takes care of the kid if you die.
Meredith: If we die, if we die.
Cristina: So, if you and Derek are on a plane crash and you die, the kid is mine?
Meredith: Yes.
Cristina: I have to admit, I kind of hope you and Derek die just a little bit. So I can raise the kid with decent priorities. 
Meredith: I have priorities.
Cristina: Oh?
Meredith: Surgery.
Cristina: Oh, okay then you can raise a good little surgeon. I take it back.

Derek: I know your loss. I lost my father when I was a kid. Two guys killed my father for his watch right in front of me. Right in front of me. I didn't become a doctor because I wanted to be God. I became a doctor because I wanted to save lives. Look at me. Please look at me in the eye. I'm a human being. I make mistakes. I'm flawed. We all are. Today, I think for you is just a mistake. You want justice. You want somebody to pay. You're a good man. I can see that in your eyes. Can you see it in mine? Can you?

Derek: [voiceover] The human life is made up of choices. Yes or no. In or out. Up or down. And then there are the choices that matter. To love or hate. To be a hero or to be a coward. To fight or to give in. To live. Or die. Live or die. That's the important choice. And it's not always in our hands.

Meredith: [to Mr. Clark] Shoot me.
Cristina: Meredith.
Meredith: You want justice right? Your wife died, I know what happened. Derek told me the story. Lexie Grey is the one that pulled the plug on your wife, she's my sister. Dr. Webber, he was your wife's doctor. I'm the closest thing he has to a daughter. And the man on the table, I'm his wife. If you wanna hurt them, the way that you hurt, shoot me. I'm your eye for an eye. 
Cristina: Meredith!
Meredith: You tell Derek that I love him and that I'm sorry. 
Cristina: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. She's pregnant. You wouldn't shoot a woman who's pregnant. Please.

Webber: [to Mr. Clark] I've lived. I've really really lived. I've failed. I've been devastated. I've been broken. I've gone to hell and back. And I've also known joy. And passion. And I've had a great love. See death for me is not justice. It's a... end of a beautiful journey. And I'm not afraid to die. The question is, are you? A life in prison or an afterlife... with your wife. Me or you? Your choice.
