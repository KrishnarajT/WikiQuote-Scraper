:<div align="justify">Alexis Castle: [takes pen from Castle] That's new.

:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: Mr. Castle, you have quite a rapsheet for a bestselling author. Disorderly conduct, resisting arrest...
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle: Boys will be boys.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: Says here you stole a police horse?
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle: Borrowed.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: And you were nude at the time?
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle: It was spring.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: And every time the charges were dropped.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle: What can I say? The mayor's a fan. But if it makes you feel better, I'd be happy to let you spank me.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: Mr. Castle, this whole bad boy charm thing that you've got going might work with bimbettes and celebutantes. Me? I work for a living. So that makes you one of two things in my world. Either the guy who makes my life easier or the guy who makes my life harder. And trust me, you do not want to be the guy who makes my life harder.
<hr width=50%>
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: Why are you here? You don't care about the victims, so you aren't here for justice. You don't care that the guy's aping your books, so you aren't here 'cause you're outraged. So what is it, Rick? Are you here to annoy me?
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle: I'm here for the story.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: The story?
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle: Why those people? Why those murders?
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: Sometimes there is no story. Sometimes the guy is just a psychopath.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle: There's always a story, always a chain of events that makes everything make sense. Take you, for example. Under normal circumstances, you should not be here. Most smart, good-looking women become lawyers, not cops. And yet, here you are. Why?
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: I don't know, Rick. You're the novelist. You tell me.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle: Well, you're not bridge and tunnel. No trace of the boroughs when you talk, so that means Manhattan, that means money. You went to college, probably a pretty good one. You had options. Yeah, you had lots of options, better options, more socially acceptable options, and you still chose this. That tells me something happened. Not to you. No, you're wounded, but you're not that wounded. No, it was somebody you cared about. It was someone you loved. And you probably could have lived with that, but the person responsible was never caught. [realizing he overstepped] And that, Detective Beckett, is why you're here.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: Cute trick. Don't think you know me.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle: The point is, there's always a story. You just have to find it.

:<div align="justify">Roy Montgomery: He's right. Neighbors in Berkowitz's building had no idea was the Son of Sam killer.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle: Thank you. What about the guy in 8B?
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: Who?
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle: 8B. Quiet guy. You see him every day, only you never notice him. But he noticed Sara. She's young, beautiful, the kind of girl that a guy like him would never have a chance with. We all know girls like that don't we? Well, at first, it's just a game. Figure out her schedule. When does she do her laundry? When is she alone? Until it becomes something more, something that he can't control. Well, he uses the stairs, obviously, to avoid the elevator's cameras. And then he just waits, concealed in the shadows. When she comes into that laundry room, he pounces. When he looked into her vacant, lifeless eyes, he wanted to tell her he never meant to kill her. All he ever wanted was to be noticed. That's when he felt the heat of that dryer on his skin. So he picks up her limp body in his arms and gently places it inside. He almost smiled at his good fortune when he found the quarter in his pocket, slipping it into the slot. Buying him the time to do what he does best ... Disappear. [pauses, then continues] Just saying, better story. Coffee?

Esposito: "Roadkill?"
Ryan: It's an accepted practice, bro. You're done with your old stuff, you leave it on the street for those less fortunate. Artists, students, former hedge-fund managers... it's trickle-down economics at its finest.

Alexis: I don't get it. If Creason didn't do it, then how does the rug fit in?
