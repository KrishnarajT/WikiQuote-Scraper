Angela: Is it true that you were crying at the crime scene?

Brennan: Why?
Angela: It's sort of like an eclipse. It doesn't happen that often.

Finn: I took it as a sign from above to keep me on the straight and narrow. I haven't so much as talk in church since.

Booth: Bones, what's the matter?  You're never like this.
Brennan: Oh, you don't think I should care about how I look?
Booth: Right.  I get it, you're an airplane propeller and I'm about to walk into you so I am going to take a step back.
Brennan: I don't know what that means.
Booth: You're just feeling a little vulnerable because you just had a baby.
Brennan: Are you saying that I resent our daughter? I love Christine.
Booth: No, no, not at all.  I just- look, what do you say we talk about this later?  We really should get to work.
Brennan: Okay, fine.  Should I wear this or this?
Booth: Uh, you know what, they're both gorgeous.
Brennan: Ugh, you're no help at all.  Absolutely no help at all! (leaves)
Booth: Did I say something wrong?

Arastoo: I got word that the journal isn't going to publish my paper.
Brennan: Is that all?

Booth: It's alright.

Booth: So, what do you think of that i got the old RC truck out. I found it.
Parker: Do you think it still works?
Booth: Of course it does. Me and Christine we put some batteries in it this morning, and we took it for a few laps.
:(Parker scowls before putting it back)
Booth: Look. Bones had to go to the lab, so maybe later, you, me and Christine, we can make some spaghetti meatballs, huh?
Parker: Christine can't really do the things you say, Dad.
Booth: I know. But we're all just really happy that your back.

Parker: I haven't seen it.
Booth: Right. Of course you haven't seen my gym bag. Why would you of seen my bag..? Where were you just now?
:(Booth looks at him in confusion)
Parker: Uh.. No where, just out exploring the woods out back.
Booth: Out back, exploring the woods? Right, then why didn't you tell the babysitter where you were?
Parker: Because i'm not a baby, Christine's the baby.
:(Booth's cell rings and he answers it)
Booth: Booth... Great so is there gonna be something else or is this all about worms..? All right, so he was beaten up.
:(Booth looks at Parker laying on the bed as he's on the phone and sees his shoes clean, before speaking on the phone again)
Booth: The karate teacher, I'll tell you what, i'll come by and pick you up and we can see if his hands match his wounds and stuff. Alright, see you in 15.
:(Booth hangs up and looks at Parker)
Booth: Hey.. Buddy, i have to get back to work, okay? Stay tight and i'll see you later on. And if you go anywhere you tell the babysitter... right, sitter. You tell the sitter where you'll be.

Parker: I haven't done anything wrong! I swear.
Booth: You've been destroying things, you've been lying to us.
Brennan: You've stolen pictures.
Parker: I haven't stolen anything!
Booth: It's best to stop right now, bud. You don't wanna make it any worse.
Parker: You don't understand.
Brennan: I do. There's an anthropological necessity for you to seek superior status within the family structure.
:(Booth looks at her and frowns)
Parker: I don't understand.
:(Booth looks at him)
Booth: Well.. she just means that we understand that it's hard for you to accept Christine.

Parker: No! No! I like her. She's my sister, I love her! You guys are ruining everything.

Parker: It was supposed to be a surprise, you would see it when you put Christine to bed! I may as well show you now.

Booth [in amazement] That's all the Mobleys and the Babcocks?
Caroline You know it, cher. They used to just kill each other and call it a day. Then they moved on to mule theft, aggravated assault and, lately since we're civilized, nuisance lawsuits.
Brennan Tribal feuds tend to be generational because the feud itself becomes a cultural identity for them.

Daisy I was thinking I could see what chemicals are in the old bones and you can analyze the soil and water table. But if it's beyond you...
Hodgins Don't...no, that is not it.

Booth I guess my bubble-head bobby wasn't flashy enough.
