[Joan Callamezzo is being honored by Pawnee]
Ben: Joan, on behalf of the entire city, congratulations. I do want to apologize for not being able to accommodate some of your requests. For example, we couldn't get a bottle of Chateau Marmont...because it's a hotel in Los Angeles not a wine. 
Joan: Well did you at least get Buddy Holly to sing?
Ben: No because he's been famously dead for 60 years.

Leslie: So this is where you want to eat lunch? In a steakhouse? Don't you have irritable bowel syndrome? God I hate that I know that. 
Jamm: Yeah it's murder on the old plumbing but Tammy only wants me to eat steak and whiskey. She has my stool analyzed just to keep me honest.
Leslie: I don't think this relationship is that healthy...I mean, it seems like Tammy is trying to turn you into Ron, and you're Jeremy Jamm! Come on! You love Porsches and spiked iced tea and you have a Hooters platinum card.
Jamm: Yeah Tammy doesn't really let me do that stuff anymore but you know it's good you know!? I'm better now. I mean sure I'm depressed...and constantly sick...and nothing really brings me joy but it just feels right!

[Ron and Leslie have been locked in their old office by their coworkers until they can become friends again. After hours of Leslie trying to figure out why Ron is mad at her, Ron has begun digging through boxes.]
Leslie: Ron, what are you doing?
Ron: I know I saw it. Aha!
[Ron pulls a detonator out of a box.]
Ron: Detonator...
[He pulls out the claymore that sat on his desk for years before he left the Parks Department.]
Ron: The partially defused claymore mine you gave me ten years ago...
[He places a box in front of a locked door and begins sitting up the claymore in front of it.]
Ron: I'm gonna use it to blow a hole in this damn door, so I can get out of here!
Leslie: Ron, just...wait a second...
Ron: No. I'm being held as a prisoner against my will, and I have the right as a citizen of the United States to blow a hole in that fucking door and walk out as a free man! It's in the Constitution!
Leslie: There's no cursing in the Constitution. Look, before you do that...
Ron: Too late! Here we go! FIRE IN THE HOLE!
[Ron hits the detonator, and instead of exploding, the claymore releases confetti and balloons and begins playing "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow."]
Leslie: Ooh!
[She grins excitedly and turns to Ron, who looks terrified and confused.]
Leslie: I gave you that as a gift on your fifth anniversary as Parks Director.
Ron: [slowly, voice cracking] You told me...this was a genuine, partially defused claymore mine.
Leslie: Well, it was! I bought the empty shell off of eBay, and then I filled it, you know, with balloons and confetti and such.
Ron: You mean to tell me I have had a toy...on my desk for ten years?
Leslie: You mean to tell me you thought you've had an actual land mine on your desk?

Ron: You left.  Then about a month later you took Terry with you.
Leslie: Yeah, well, we needed a mindless factotum and he's the best there is.
Ron Amen. [pause] Then you took April. I didn't want her to go as she had become one of my closest workplace acquaintances, but your offer was too good to pass up so I didn't try to stop her.  Then Tom left to run his business, Donna left to run hers.  One day, I looked up, just didn't recognize anyone.  So I made a decision.  An unthinkable decision.
[flashback to Ron walking into Leslie's office]
Leslie: Hey!  Well, my my my, do my eyes deceive me?  Is that Ron Swanson?
Ron Hello, Leslie.  Hello, April, Larry.
Larry: Uh, it's Terry now.
Ron: OK.  As luck would have it-
[Leslie is handed a report from a subordinate]
Leslie: Just a second.  Oh, did you talk to Randy about the vote? Tell the northeast that we need to put pressure on them or else we're gonna be waiting forever and I'm tired of waiting on them, OK? [Leslie turns back to Ron] Sorry, this is a crazy day.  So what's up with you, you big lug?
Ron: Nothing important.  Just thought you might want to have lunch.  Tomorrow?
Leslie: I would love to!  It's been too long!  JJ's Diner, 12:30.
Ron: Excellent.  See ya then.
Leslie: OK!
April: So Randy says the House is voting tomorrow and they need us in Washington to prep.
Leslie: Oh my God, really? 
April: Yep.
Leslie: OK, get us the first flight out of here, grab the Missouri files, meet me at my car. [April hands Leslie her cell, with Ben on the line]  Hey babe, I gotta go to Washington.  Can you pick up the kids?
[cuts back to 2017]
Leslie: Aw, oh no, Ron. I stood you up for lunch.
Ron: You did, yes.  I waited for a while but it was pretty easy to figure out what had happened.  Your life seemed pretty hectic.
Leslie: Is that the rest of the story?  That I stood you up? [Ron goes silent]  You were going to ask me something.  That's why you wanted to have lunch.  Ron, you were going-?
Ron: I was going to ask you for a job.  In the federal government.  Just saying it out loud feels dirty.
Leslie: You missed your friends and you wanted to come up to the third floor and work with us again.  I can't even imagine how hard that must have been for you.  God, why didn't I see that?  Ron, I'm so sorry.  I should have been a better friend to you.
Ron: Honestly, Leslie, it's fine.  It was a punctuation mark on a sentence that had already been written.  My time in government work was over.  Sure, I love shutting things down and bleeding the rotting beast from the inside...
Leslie: Your metaphors are so beautiful.
Ron: ...but it was time for me to leave.  And I didn't feel like explaining why to you or anyone.  Everything that happened after - the fight we had, not giving you a heads up when my company took on the Morningstar development, when I bulldozed the nurse's old house - I do regret that.  I had a good run here, but after you and Tom and Donna and April and Terry left, I looked around this office, nothing was the same.
Leslie: Yeah, well, there's a way to fix that.
