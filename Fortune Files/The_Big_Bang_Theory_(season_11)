Amy: [incredulous] Really? You're gonna answer that right now?
Sheldon: It's Leonard. I don't want to be rude.
Leonard: Hey, where you been? We've been calling you for hours.
Sheldon: Oh, I'm sorry. My phone was on "airplane" mode.
Leonard: Why?
Sheldon: Because I was on an airplane. [gives Amy a "duh" look]
Penny: Hey, where are you?
Sheldon: I came to Princeton to see Amy. It's a funny story, actually. I was having lunch with Dr. Nowitzki, and she kissed me.
Penny: Excuse me?
Leonard: What?
Amy I'm sorry?
Sheldon: And in that moment, I realized that Amy was the only woman I ever wanted to kiss for the rest of my life. So I came to New Jersey to ask her to marry me.

Amy: [giddily] We're engaged!
Mary: I am so happy for you two, but I'm not surprised. I've been praying for this.
Sheldon: Well, God had nothing to do with it. It happened because I was kissing another woman, and it made me realize I wanted to be with Amy.
Mary: More than one woman was interested in you? I might have prayed a little too hard.
Sheldon: I want to let you know right now that we are not getting married in a church.
Mary: That's all right, Sheldon. Anywhere Jesus is is a church.
Sheldon: Well, he won't be at our wedding.
Mary: He's in my heart, so if I'm there, he'll be there.
Sheldon: Okay, well, then he's your plus-one. You don't get to bring anyone else.
Mary: That's fine. Love you.

Raj: Are you saying that you don't believe two people fall in love?
Ruchi: Of course they do. It's just that what people call "love" is actually a series of biochemical reactions in the brain, that fade over time.
Raj: Yes. Like the old song "When a Man Has a Biochemical Reaction For a Woman".
Ruchi: Raj, we're scientists. We don't need to feel threatened just because we understand the mechanisms that give rise to romantic feelings. It doesn't take anything away from the experience. 
Raj: Yes, it does. Actually, it takes everything away from it. Love isn't just science, okay? It's spiritual. It's an acknowledgement of a mystery that's greater than ourselves. It's what makes people write songs, and poems, and what has kept The Bachelor on TV for twenty-one magical seasons.
Ruchi: Don't you think the fact that love is given away as a prize on a game show slightly undermines your argument?
