Meredith: [voiceover] Even good marriages fail. One minute you're standing on solid ground, the next minute- you're not. And there're always two versions. Yours, and theirs. The both versions start the same way though. The both start with two people falling in love. You think yours is the one that's gonna make it. So it always comes as a shock. The moment you realize it's over. One minute you're standing on solid ground, the next minute, you're not.

Owen: This isn't any of your business. 
Meredith: Okay, do you know what will happen to Cristina if she has a kid that she doesn't want? It will almost kill her. Trying to pretend that she loves a kid as much as she loves surgery will almost kill her, and it'll almost kill your kid. Do you know what it's like to be raised by someone who didn't want you? I do. To know you stood in the way of your mother's career? I do. I was raised by a Cristina. My mother was a Cristina. And as the child she didn't want, I am telling you, don't do this to her, because she's kind and she cares and she won't make it. The guilt of resenting her own kid will eat her alive.

I don't wanna make jam, I don't wanna carpool, and I really, really, don't wanna be a mother. I wanna be a surgeon. And please, get it. I need someone to get it.

But, this afternoon when it looked like you two had split up, your wife got fired, she lied to me and left with the baby. It set off some alarms. Now, I'm trying to dial them all back but it's not that easy to do. Once a system has been set in motion, there's protocol that needs to be followed once the agency believes there's questions about Meredith...

Janet: Derek, please. I hear you. But no matter what I say social services still needs to re-evaluate the placement and when that happens, Zola can't be in your home. I'll give you a minute to say good-bye.

[Alex turns back]

Alex: They, uh, gave me the international rotation and the moving expenses, and they took care of, uh, all my loans-- college, med school.

Miranda: You're a physician. Is this really the first time you missed a lunch and the crossword because of a surgery?
Meredith: Here we go.
Ben: It was important to me.
Miranda: Well, this parasite's important to me.
Ben: Yeah, I can see that.
Miranda: You know what? Fine. Let's do it right now. Give me the damn crossword.
Ben: Just forget it.
Miranda: Oh, no. Nobody's ever gonna forget it. Where is Dr. Warren's bag?
Ben: Miranda...
Miranda: Oh, there it is.
Derek: And this is why you don't work with your girlfriend.
Meredith: I warned them.
Miranda: Here we go. Oh, this is gonna be so great. It's way better than a once-in-a-lifetime, bone-eating parasite. Let's see. One down.
Ben: Dr. Bailey...
Miranda: Oh, no, no, no. No help from you. I'm too excited. This is what I live for. Let's see "Peruvian mountain range". Oh, Andes. Five, uh-huh. "Planet with water, four letters". Oh, Mars. Duh. Uh,"fancy sauce"? Fancy... ooh. Remoulade.
Ben: Stop.
Miranda: What? No, no. I'm on a roll. Come on. Hey, this can't be the Sunday, 'cause this is way too easy. What's ... Oh, hey, this one, 21 across. "My question to you." Hmm.
Ben: I'm asking you to put it away.
Derek: He's asking you nicely, Dr. Bailey.
Miranda: Oh, no, no, no. When he doesn't get his way, he holds on to it in his cheek like a squirrel with a nut. We are doing the crossword. What is "my question to you"? It's a bunch of letters. Um ... oh, maybe it's a phrase. "My question to you," anybody?
Meredith: How many letters?
Miranda: Uh, 2 ... 9 ... 13.
Derek: It's 13 letters?
Ben: 14.
Miranda: No, I'm looking at it. It's 13.
Ben: No, it's 14. Count again.
Miranda: I just counted. What, do you have X-ray vision from across the room?
Ben: "Will you marry me" is my question to you. And the reason why it's so easy is because I made the crossword. Took me two damn months not to mention getting a mockup made of "The New York Times." The phrase has 14 letters. "Will," four,"you," seven, "marry," 12,"me" ... 14.

Meredith: [voiceover]: I don't know how those birds do it. Travel thousand of miles without getting lost. Banging into windows, being eaten by cats. But every spring they are always here. I guess they come back to what they know. People say it's pretty cool watching them go. They say you can actually see the moment when at some mysterious signal, all at once, the birds decide to leave. So maybe I've been missing out. Whatever. There's always next year.

Richard Webber: [voiceover] A month ago, you were in med school being taught by doctors. Today, you are the doctors. The seven years you spend here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst of your life. You will be pushed to the breaking point. Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty. Five of you will crack under the pressure. Two of you will be asked to leave. This is your starting line. This is your arena. How well you play? That’s up to you.

Jackson:  I chose Tulane.
April:  Good. That's good for you.
Jackson: Yeah. ... I feel sick, by the way. Sick to leave here, to leave you. But, uh, I'm glad-- I'm glad you're so friggin' happy about it.
April: I'm not. I'm not happy with any of it. I'm not happy that everything I thought I was turns out not to be true. Um, I'm not a board certified surgeon. I'm not a virgin. I'm not a good Christian. I don't know what I am, but I know I'm not happy. I loved having sex with you. You made me feel things... You changed me, Jackson. And I loved that. But I hate that I'm not a virgin for the man I'm gonna marry. [voice breaking] I'm not freakin' happy about that. And I'm really not happy that you feel bad about it, 'cause you're my best friend. But you know what? Torres is right. My problems will still be my problems tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that. And in a few weeks, my best friend will be at Tulane, and I may never see him again, so... For one night, I'm just gonna forget all about that. And I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try to be happy.
