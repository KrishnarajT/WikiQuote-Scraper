Lisbon: Good. He gave up his DNA just like you said he would. He's behind this, Jane. I know it.
Jane: But?
Lisbon:When the grand jury investigation was dropped, Volker's lawyers had all the evidence and court documents sealed from the case, including Jones' deposition. I think there's something in there that Volker doesn't want us to know. If I could just get my hands on it... 
Jane: Well, why can't you?
Lisbon: They're sealed documents, Jane. It's against the law.
Jane: Well, if you want to get Volker, you can't let that stop you.
Lisbon: What do you suggest?
Jane: Well, Ardiles is a Deputy D.A. He's gonna have the deposition.
Lisbon: Ardiles is not gonna stick his neck out for me.
Jane: Well, of course not. He's a smart lawyer. You have to get something on him that will make him help you.
Lisbon: Blackmail the deputy district attorney?

Jane: Need? No. I just wanted to meet you while I have the chance.
