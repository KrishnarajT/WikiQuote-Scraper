Root: So, you see, sadly, I need to be moving on.
Ronald Carmichael: Okay. So, um, you're going to escape? Hmm. And how do you plan on doing that? 
Root: First the phone on your desk will ring. She'll be letting me know it's time. Then I'll punch you in the carotid artery. It'll hurt, Ronald, but it won't kill you. Then I'll take your car keys. 
Ronald Carmichael: And the guards, how how will you manage them? 
Root: I won't have to. They'll be incapacitated from the desflurane in the ventilation system. It vaporizes at 75 degrees. Which the building climate control has been programmed to reach ten minutes ago.
Ronald Carmichael:  Okay, this voice that you hear, she is she's gonna do all this? 
Root: Of course not. She sees everything, but there's very little she can do about it herself. That's where I come in. She tells me what to do and I do it. Well, she did help me a little with stealing the desflurane from the automatic dispensing system. Don't worry. I closed the vents in your office two days ago. It should have cleared out by now. Do you hear how quiet it is out there? Must be almost time. Are you as excited about this as I am?
John Reese: You framed your own wife for murder. You deceived me to kill your own husband. I'm in the business of stopping bad things from happening. I'm not so sure what's about to happen is a bad thing.

John Reese: You see? That's why you and I understand each other. Now, everything you do is an abomination. But your word...your word is your bond. To your godson. To Carter. You do what you say. So do I. I'm not gonna threaten to kill you. I'm going to kill you whether you tell me or not. No bargaining. In three minutes you're dead. I've killed many people. Never bothered me much. That's why I was good at it. I didn't like them suffering, though. Took me years to figure out how to do it quickly, painlessly. But if you don't tell me, I'm gonna forget all of that. Understand?

She was good for me, for a lot of reasons. She reminded me that I could be good again, too. I could be a good father, a good friend...a good cop. I'm not gonna let you undo all the good she did.

Carl Elias: That's not really my style.
Patrick Simmons: Then why the hell are you here? 
Carl Elias: Well, there remains a debt. Civilization rests on the principle that we treat our criminals better than they treated their victims, that we not stoop to their level. But you and I are outliers. We're not really a part of civilization. We're something older. Which means, of course, that we can do the things that civilized people can't. I offered to kill you for Detective Carter many times, and she always said no. She was civilized to the very end. I don't think she liked me. But I liked her very much, and you killed her. So now I consider it my responsibility to fix the particular problem that is you, Officer Simmons.
Patrick Simmons: You really think you're gonna be the one to kill me? 
Carl Elias: No. No, my friend is going to kill you. I'm just gonna watch.
