Meredith: [voiceover] To be a good surgeon you have to think like a surgeon. Emotions are messy. Tuck them neatly away and step into a clean sterile room where the procedure is simple. Cut, suture, and close. But sometimes you're faced with a cut that won't heal. A cut that rips its stitches wide open.

Derek: So I go upstairs, as I'm walking down the hall I'm trying to prepare myself for what I'm going to see when I go into my bedroom. I step on a man's jacket that doesn't belong to me. And everything I think I know just shifts. Because the jacket that doesn't belong to me is a jacket that I recognize, what I know now is that when I go into my bedroom, I'm not just going to see that my wife is cheating on me. I'm going to see that my wife is cheating on me with Mark, who happened to be my best friend. It's just so pedestrian, common and dirty, and cruel. Mostly just cruel. I left, came out here.
Meredith: Then you met me.
Derek: And I met you.
Meredith: What was I to you? The girl you screwed to get over being screwed?

I've never met a surgeon that enjoys a surprise, because as surgeons, we like to be in the know. We have to be in the know, because when we aren't, people die and lawsuits happen. Am I rambling? I think I'm rambling. Okay, so my point, actually, and I do have one, has nothing to do with surprises or death or lawsuits, or even surgeons. My point is this: whoever said "What you don't know can't hurt you", was a complete and total moron. Because for most people I know, not knowing is the worst feeling in the world.

George: I don't want to talk! Not to you! I wanted to keep my mouth shut. And if you hadn't been running away from me every time you see me, you would know that!
Meredith: Okay, you're right, but can we just talk now?
George: You want to talk now, because you told everyone that we had sex!
Izzie: You had sex?
Cristina: You had sex with George?
George: You didn't tell them?
Meredith: No.
George: DAMMIT! [trips and falls down stairwell]

George: [voiceover] One way or another our karma will leave us to face ourselves. We can look our karma in the eye or we can wait for it to sneak up on us from behind. One way or another, our karma will always find us. And the truth is, as surgeons, we have more chances than most to set the balance in our favor. No matter how hard we try we can't escape our karma. It follows us home. I guess we can't really complain about karma. It's not unfair. It's not unexpected. It just... evens the score. And even when we're about to do something we know will tempt karma to bite us in the ass... well, it goes without saying. We do it anyway.

Meredith: [voiceover] My college campus has a magic statue. It's a longstanding tradition for students to rub its nose for good luck. My freshman roommate really believed in the statue's power and insisted on visiting it to rub its nose before every exam. Studying might have been a better idea, she flunked out at sophomore year. The fact is, we all have little superstitious things that we do. If it's not believing in magic statues, it's avoiding sidewalk cracks or always putting our left shoe on first. Knock on wood. Step on a crack, break your mothers back. The last thing we want to do is offend the gods.

Derek: Juju.
Addison: Yep.
Derek: You juju'ed Meredith.
Addison: I did, in the spirit of friendship.
Derek: Hmmm.
Addison: What, are we not being friends with Meredith anymore?
Derek: No, no, we are. Meredith and I are friends.
Addison: And you and I are married. So then by proxy, Meredith and I are friends.
Derek: That's very big of you.
Addison: Yeah.
Derek: You don't have to do that. It’s not like I'm going to be friends with... let's say... Mark.
Addison: Yeah, well, neither am I. Now finish your juju before somebody else dies.

Cristina: Great. No blood, no guts, no lives to save. It's dead quiet.
Bailey: Uh, did you really just say that?
Izzie: Cristina!
Cristina: What?
George: You said the "q" word.
Izzie: That's like saying Macbeth in the theatre.
Cristina: Please.  You think because someone says its quiet that'll mean---

Meredith: [voiceover] Superstition lies in the space between what we can control and what we can't. Find a penny, pick it up, and all day long you'll have good luck. No one wants to pass up a chance for good luck, but does saying it thirty three times really help? Is anyone really listening? And if no ones listening, why do we bother doing those strange things at all? We rely on superstitions because we're smart enough to know we don't have all the answers. And that life works in mysterious ways. Don't diss the juju, from wherever it comes.

Meredith:  [voiceover] The key to being a successful intern is what we give up: sleep, friends, a normal life. We sacrifice it all for that one amazing moment, that moment when you can legally call yourself a surgeon. There are days that make the sacrifices seem worthwhile. And then there are the days where everything feels like a sacrifice. And then there are the sacrifices that you can't even figure out why you're making.

Izzie: Make her seize? How do we make someone have a seizure?
Derek: Well do your research, get creative.
George: But if all the normal methods have failed then... what are we supposed to do?
Derek: Use a strobe-light, get her drunk, hang her from the ceiling upside down and hit her with a wiffle bat for all I care, okay? Just make her seize, because until she seizes I don't know what to operate. And if I don't know what to operate, I can't get this woman out of my life. And this woman is now how I like to start my mornings.

Meredith [voiceover]: A wise man once said – "You can have anything in life if you will sacrifice everything else for it." What he meant is nothing comes without a price. So before you go into battle, you better decide how much you're willing to lose. Too often going after what feels good means letting go of what you know is right. And letting someone in means abandoning the walls you've spent a lifetime building. Of course the toughest sacrifices are the ones we don't see coming. [...] When we don’t have time to come up with a strategy to pick a side or to measure the potential loss. When that happens, when the battle chooses us, and not the other way around, that's when the sacrifice can turn out to be more than we can bear.

Meredith: Human beings need a lot of things to feel alive.
George: Family...
Cristina: Love...
Izzie: Sex.
Derek: But we only need one thing...
Burke: To actually be alive.
Cristina: We need a beating heart.
Addison: When our heart is threatened...
Alex: We respond in one of two ways.
George: We either run... 
Derek: Or...
Izzie: We attack.
Webber: There's a scientific term for this:

Denny: What? You like your men sick and feeble? You don't dig healthy guys?
Izzie: [laughs] I dig you.
Denny:  Then why are you all swirly and twitchy?
Izzie: No I'm not.
Denny: Yeah, you're swirly and twitchy. It's 'cause I asked you to marry me.
Izzie: So you remember that?
Denny:  It's not the kind of thing I'd forget.
Izzie: Yeah. Look, Denny, um, I'm giving you an out.
Denny:  Excuse me?
Izzie: Well, I'm giving you an out. I mean, you thought you were dying and I was saving your life and, you know, everything was so... So, I won't hold it against you, or be hurt and offended if you want to take your proposal back, I mean giving you an out.
Denny: I don't want an out.
Izzie: You should take the out. We can't get married. I mean that would be crazy, insane. We should date, and have sex. Plenty of sex. You know when your heart gets better and you're out of the hospital, all the sex you can handle. But marriage is, um, marriage, I mean...
Denny:  Okay, it's my turn now.
Izzie: But I need to...
Denny:  No, no. We're taking turns. I've decided. It's polite and it keeps me from yelling. When it's your turn again, you can talk.  [pause] For five years, I've had to live by the choices of my doctors. The guys that cut me open decided my life, there wasn't one choice that was mine. And now, I have this heart that beats and works. I get to be like everybody else, I get to make my own decisions, have my own life, do whatever the damn hell I choose. Now here's the good part, so you listen close. What I choose is you. You're who I want to wake up with and go to bed with and do everything in between with. I get a choice now. I get to choose. I choose you, Izzie Stevens. OK, it's your turn again.

Webber: [one on one meeting with Cristina] I know your type. You're a surgical junkie.
Cristina:  Yes, sir.
Webber: I'm just saying, it's not going to be easy for you to be away from the OR that long.
Cristina:  No, sir.
Webber: And if you want to get back to the OR, you're gonna tell me what I need to know, aren't you?
Cristina:  You're right, it's not easy for me to be away from the OR. And it's not easy for me to sit in front of you, or any other authority figure for that matter, and not be able to give you the exact answer you want to hear. I'm the one with the answers. I've always been the one with the answers. But right now sir, I don't have any.
Webber: Dr. Yang.
Cristina:  How do you keep your edge sir? Because I've watch you and you've been doing this a long time and you're clean, you're focused, you are the job, nothing gets to you. And the thing is sir, I was like that, until I got here. Until I actually started doing this job and now everything is, is fuzzy...
Webber: That's beside the point.
Cristina:  No see sir, this is the point. Because I can't tell you what happened in that room, I can't tell you. And before I could have, no guilt, no loyalties, no problem. Before, before I wouldn't have even been in that room. I wouldn't have gotten involved. I would have never frozen in surgery. And I would have told him what I thought he should do. I had an edge, sir. I had an edge and I've lost it, and I need it. I need it back. [tearing up] So, if you could just tell me, how you keep yours and how not to be affected, I know I could be a great surgeon. So if you could just give me the answers, I would really appreciate it.
Webber: You're excused Dr. Yang.
Cristina:  But...
Webber: You're excused.
Cristina: I'll tell you, I'll tell you who cut the LVAD wires, sir, if you'll please...
Webber: No you won't, I don't want to know. Not from you. Yeah, I have the answers, but I can't tell them to you. I'm not going to be responsible for you becoming less human.
