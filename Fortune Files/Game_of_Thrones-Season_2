[Tyrion enters the Small Council Chamber, whistling "The Rains of Castamere"]
Tyrion Lannister: Don't get up! More ravishing than ever, Big Sister! War agrees with you! [Kisses Cersei on the cheek.]  Excuse the interruption. Carry on. 
Cersei Lannister: What are you doing here?
Tyrion Lannister: It's been a... remarkable journey! I pissed off the edge of the Wall. I slept in a sky-cell. I fought with the Hill-tribes! So many adventures, so much to be thankful for! 
Cersei Lannister: What are you doing here? This is the Small Council.
Tyrion Lannister: Yes, well, I do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all Small Council meetings.
Cersei Lannister: Father is Hand of the King!
Tyrion Lannister: Yes. But in his absence...
[He hands a small scroll to Varys, who unrolls it]
Varys: Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights.
Cersei Lannister: OUT! All of you, out! 
[The rest of the Council leaves hastily as Cersei storms around the table towards Tyrion.]
Cersei Lannister: I would like to know how you tricked Father into this!
Tyrion Lannister: If I were capable of tricking Father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself.
Cersei Lannister: I've done nothing.
Tyrion Lannister: Quite right, you did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
Cersei Lannister: I tried to stop it.
Tyrion Lannister: Did you? You failed. That bit of theatre will haunt our family for a generation.
Cersei Lannister: Robb Stark is a child.
Tyrion Lannister: Who's won every battle he's fought! Do you understand we're losing the war?
Cersei Lannister: What do you know about warfare?
Tyrion Lannister: Nothing. But I know people, and I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us. 
Cersei Lannister: Joffrey is King.
Tyrion Lannister: Joffrey is King.
Cersei Lannister: You are here to advise him.
Tyrion Lannister: Only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his uncle Jaime back.
Cersei Lannister: How?
Tyrion Lannister: You love your children. It’s your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well, and we have two of them.
Cersei Lannister: One.
Tyrion Lannister: One?
Cersei Lannister: Arya, that little animal, she disappeared.
Tyrion Lannister: Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?! We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one’s head off, and let another escape. Father would be furious. Must be hard for you, to be the disappointing child.

Jaime Lannister: The King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.
Robb Stark: If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannermen would receive a raven with a message: "Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse, and your house'll be destroyed, root and stem."
Jaime Lannister: You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
Robb Stark: Oh, I trust them with my life, just not with yours.
Jaime Lannister: Smart, boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called boy? Insulted? 
[Jaime sees Robb's direwolf, Grey Wind, stalking around the cage.]
Robb Stark: You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy. You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. 
[Grey Wind enters the cage doorway and stands quietly next to Robb.]
Robb Stark: Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the High Lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true King, nor a true Baratheon. He's your bastard son.
Jaime Lannister: Well, if that's true, Stannis is the rightful King. How convenient for him.
Robb Stark: My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
Jaime Lannister: I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
Robb Stark: Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him and you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the Queen. 
Jaime Lannister: You have proof? Or, do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
Robb Stark: I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
Jaime Lannister: You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
Robb Stark: No, but he's starting to know me.
Jaime Lannister: Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
Robb Stark: It's better than three defeats. 
<hr width="50%" />
Robb Stark: I offer your cousins peace, if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us, so that he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must be returned also, that their families can honor them with proper funerals.
Alton Lannister: An honorable request, your Grace.
Robb Stark: Third, Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time to the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.
Northern Lords: The King in the North!
Robb Stark: Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall ever set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father...only I won't need a servant to do my beheading for me!
Alton Lannister: [stammering] Your Grace...these are...
Robb Stark: These are my terms! If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead.
Alton Lannister: King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.
Robb Stark: Is he?

Salladhor Saan: One thing. I want the Queen.
Davos Seaworth: The Queen?
Salladhor Saan: Cersei. I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all thirty of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I'll fuck this blond queen and I'll fuck her well.
Mathos Seaworth: This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the Queen!
Salladhor Saan: I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her.
Mathos Seaworth: As if she would just let you.
Salladhor Saan: You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you. 
Matthos Seaworth: Stannis is the rightful King and the Lord of Light!
Salladhor Saan: I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go people tell me about the "true god". They all think they found the right one. The one﻿ true God is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a Queen's legs. [Matthos walks away as Salladhor turns to Davos] I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
Davos Seaworth: Ah, he's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the Queen.
Salladhor Saan: You believe your king can win?
Davos Seaworth: He is the one, true king.
Salladhor Saan: You Westerosi are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him! I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You're the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich.

Tyrion Lannister: I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
Janos Slynt: Nasty business. Had to be done.
Tyrion Lannister: Yes, of course. The City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.
Janos Slynt: Orders are orders.
Tyrion Lannister: Quite right, especially the Queen's orders. 
Janos Slynt: I never said they were the Queen's orders.
Tyrion Lannister: No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.
Janos Slynt: You know your sister better than I do.
Tyrion Lannister: You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
Janos Slynt: I don't listen to filth.
Tyrion Lannister:  Well, that's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the Throne than Cersei's children.
Janos Slynt: Joffrey is my King. The rest doesn't interest me.
Tyrion Lannister: I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me, when your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men in the throne room, did you give the order?
Janos Slynt: I did, and I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
Tyrion Lannister: The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
Janos Slynt: Are you drunk?! I'll not have my honor questioned by an imp!
Tyrion Lannister: I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos; I'm denying its existence.
Janos Slynt: [standing up] If you think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf-
Tyrion Lannister: "Dwarf"? You should've stopped at "Imp"!  And, yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here! 
[Janos looks to his right and sees Bronn standing there, grinning]  
Tyrion Lannister: I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war. And since you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.  
Janos Slynt: What are you... my friends at Court will not allow this! The Queen herself-
Tyrion Lannister: The Queen Regent! And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.
Janos Slynt: We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this!
Tyrion Lannister: No, we shan't. [Nods to Bronn, who nods to four Gold-Cloaks marching into the room] There's a ship leaving for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight. From there, it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful. In a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way. 
Bronn: The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my Lord. 
Janos Slynt: These men are under my command! I command you to arrest this cutthroat!
Tyrion Lannister: His name is Bronn, and he is the new Commander of the City Watch. 
Bronn: Boys? 
[The Gold Cloaks seize Lord Janos and lead him out of the room.
Janos Slynt: I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The King himself made me a Lord!
Tyrion Lannister: To the new Commander. [They toast and drink] If I told you to murder an infant girl, say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it, without question?
Bronn: Without question? No. I'd ask how much. 
<hr width="50%" />
Cersei Lannister: Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him!
Tyrion Lannister: I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
Cersei Lannister: You're serving as the King's Hand until Father gets here. I am the Queen Regent.
Tyrion Lannister: Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?
Cersei Lannister: The people? You think I care?
Tyrion Lannister: You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half this city will starve when winter comes, the other half will plot to overthrow you...and your gold-plated thugs just gave them their rallying cry. "The Queen slaughters babies!" You don't even have the decency to deny it! It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you? Did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.
Cersei Lannister: He did what needed to be done. You want to be Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is, lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root, one by one, before they strangle you in your sleep.
Tyrion Lannister: I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling than that.
Cersei Lannister: I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. It's all fallen on me.
Tyrion Lannister: As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon. 
Cersei Lannister: You're funny. You've always been funny...but none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? Do you remember, back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death?
Tyrion Lannister: She was my mother too.
Cersei Lannister: Mother gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that.

Bran Stark: Every night it's the same: I'm walking, running, but I'm not me. I'm running through the Godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.
Maester Luwin: That's exactly what they were, Bran: stories.
Bran Stark: So she was lying? They don't exist?
Maester Luwin: Well, they may have done, but they're gone from the world along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.
Bran Stark: No. My dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying and Rickon had the same dream.
Maester Luwin: What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? [removes a link from his chain] This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one Maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries, and all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was not different. I was young and what boy doesn't secretly wish for special powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one, but in the end, for all of my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on. [tucks Bran back to bed] Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world, but not anymore; the dragons are gone, the giants are dead, and the children of the forest forgotten.

Tyrion Lannister: Dorne is the safest place for her.

Varys: Three great men sit in a room; a king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?
Tyrion Lannister: Depends on the sellsword.
Varys: Does it? He has neither crown, nor gold, nor the favour of the gods.
Tyrion Lannister: He has a sword, the power of life and death.
Varys: But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?
Tyrion Lannister: I've decided I don't like riddles.
Varys: Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall, and a very small man can cast a very large shadow.

Renly Baratheon: 'Born amidst salt and smoke'? Is he a ham?

Catelyn Stark: Listen to yourselves! If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber together until you remember you're brothers.
Stannis Baratheon: It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim; Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me? 
Catelyn Stark: We share a common enemy!
Stannis Baratheon: The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those who deny that are my foes.
Renly Baratheon: The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattles and unborn children deny it in their mothers' wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother, but a man without friends is a man without power.
Stannis Baratheon: For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn and I will grant you your old seat on the Council. I'll even name you my heir, until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you.

Tyrion Lannister: I remember reading an old sailor's proverb: "Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off."
Wisdom Hallyne: Oh... no, well, I've not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel. And of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow. After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power. [Bronn scoffs]
Tyrion Lannister: My companion takes issue.
Bronn: If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps, making grand claims about jars full of pig shit... no offense meant.
Wisdom Hallyne: Our order does not deal in pig shit! The substance is fire given form, and we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
Bronn: To do what?
Wisdom Hallyne: The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
Tyrion Lannister: How much do you have? [Hallyne gestures for them to follow]
Bronn: If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten. But all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.
Wisdom Hallyne: My lord, this man is insulting.
Bronn: I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cos when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging 'em right back at us. Men die. Men shit themselves. Men run. Which means pots falling. Which means fire inside the walls. Which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.
Tyrion Lannister: My friend remains unconvinced.
Wisdom Hallyne: He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
Bronn: Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks.

Wisdom Hallyne: We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both.

Tyrion Lannister: I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Hallyne. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me.

Bran Stark: Why?
Theon Greyjoy: To take the castle.
Bran Stark: You went with Robb.
Theon Greyjoy: And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
Bran Stark: I don't know.
Theon Greyjoy: [To Dagmer] Find the halfwit. My men are bringing your people into the courtyard.
Bran Stark: Why?
Theon Greyjoy: So you and I can go down and tell them how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
Bran Stark: I won't!
Theon Greyjoy: Yes you will.

Bran Stark: I won't! I'll never yield. I'll fight you and throw you out.
Theon Greyjoy: The castle is mine but these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe. To keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say.

Robb Stark: There will be no talk, he will die for this!
Roose Bolton: Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort; he can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon.

Stannis Baratheon: No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life!
Davos Seaworth: He was only a boy.
Stannis Baratheon: Then why give him Storm's End? First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine. The horses, then the cats. I've never liked cats, so fine. I do like dogs, good animals, loyal, but we ate them too. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines, slipped right through in your little black sail boat with your onions...

Stannis Baratheon: Every man at Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
Davos Seaworth: I was relieved they did not.
Stannis Baratheon: Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up because Robert was my older brother and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I am the rightful king by every law of Westeros.

Tyrion Lannister: We talked about this.
Bronn: Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people, it's the starving. Food's worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other. The thieves? They love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.

Maester Luwin: [In a gentle tone.] Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch. Once a man has taken the black, he is beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven. 
Theon Greyjoy: I won't make it to the wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.
Maester Luwin: There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there.
Theon Greyjoy: The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep!
Maester Luwin: The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
Theon Greyjoy: I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing. 
Maester Luwin: I've known you for many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you are pretending to be. Not yet. 
Theon Greyjoy: You may be right. I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.

[Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie encounter Jaqen on the road after their escape from Harrenhal]
Arya Stark: What are you doing here?
Jaqen H'ghar: Waiting for you.
Arya Stark: How did you know we'd come this way?
Jaqen H'ghar: After all the things you have seen, this is your question?
Arya Stark: How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?
Jaqen H'ghar: No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way.
Arya Stark: Show me how. I want to be able to do it too.
Jaqen H'ghar: If you would learn, you must come with me.
Arya Stark: Where?
Jaqen H'ghar: Far and away across the Narrow Sea, to Braavos.
Arya Stark: My dancing master's from Braavos.
Jaqen H'ghar: [chuckles] To be a dancing master is a special thing, but... to be a Faceless Man... that is something else entirely. A girl has many names on her lips. Joffrey. Cersei. Tywin Lannister. Ilyn Payne. The Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all. One by one.
Arya Stark: I want to... but I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her too.
Jaqen H'ghar: Then we must part. A man has duties as well. [reaches into a pouch and produces a coin] Here.
Arya Stark: What is it?
Jaqen H'ghar: A coin of great value.
Arya Stark: [takes the coin] Could it buy a horse?
Jaqen H'ghar: It is not meant for the buying of horses.
Arya Stark: Then what good is it?
Jaqen H'ghar: If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him: "Valar morghulis."
Arya Stark: "Valar morghulis."
[Jaqen starts to walk away]
Arya Stark: Please don't go, Jaqen.
Jaqen H'ghar: [turns back to Arya] Jaqen is dead. Say it again: "Valar morghulis."
Arya Stark: "Valar morghulis."
Jaqen H'ghar: Good. [turns away, and when he looks back, his face has mysteriously changed to that of a stranger. Arya stares at him in shock] Farewell, Arya Stark.
