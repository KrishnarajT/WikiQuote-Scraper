Phoebe: Look, [Long pause] Precious. Mike's not worth this, you're an attractive, intelligent woman and, let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you, he was gonna break up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss and tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
Precious: Oh my god, you know? Maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect [Mike comes in] Screw you, Mike, you're a coward and a bastard and I hope you rot in hell! [Slaps him and leaves]

Ross: O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it that you two are together. And that one day you might get married and have children of your own.
Joey: Dude, are you okay?
Ross: Totally.
Rachel: Ross, you don't seem okay.
Ross: I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
