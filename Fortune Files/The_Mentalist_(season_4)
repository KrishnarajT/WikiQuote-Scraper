Lisbon: I'm okay. You, on the other hand.
Jane: Oh, I'm okay too. 
Lisbon: You killed an unarmed man in front of five hundred witnesses. You're not okay.
Jane: He had a gun. Someone must have taken it and switched the cell phone. It's the only possible explanation.
Lisbon: That or you went nuts for a moment.
Jane: Lisbon, look at me. I didn't go nuts.
Lisbon: I believe you. I'm not sure a jury will.
