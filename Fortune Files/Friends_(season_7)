Monica: What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund, don't you?
Jack: Yes, we have it. Only now we call it the beach house.
Monica: I can't believe - there is no money for my wedding?
Judy: We might have some money if your father hadn't thought it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
Jack: It seemed like such a simple idea.

Monica: I've been thinking - it's not right for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding; you worked hard for that.
Chandler: I thought about it, too - and when I proposed, I said I would do anything to make you happy. And if having the perfect wedding will make you happy, then that's what we'll do.
Monica: But what about the future and stuff?
Chandler: Forget about the future and stuff. So we'll only have two kids; we'll pick our favorite, and that one will get to go to college.
Monica: You thought about that?
Chandler: Yeah.
Monica: How many kids were we going to have?
Chandler: Four - a boy, twin girls, and another boy.
Monica: What else do you think about?
Chandler: Stuff like where we'd live - like a small place outside the city where our kids can learn to ride their bikes and stuff, and we'd have a cat with a bell on its collar, and we can hear it every time it ran through the kitty door. Then we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey can grow old.
Monica: I don't want a big fancy wedding anymore.
Chandler: Sure you do.
Monica: No - I want everything you just said; I want a marriage.
