Robb Stark: There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
Jon Snow: Now there are five. You want to hold it?

Bran Stark: Where will they go?
Rodrik Cassel: They don't belong down here.
Ned Stark:  Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.

Robb Stark: Put away your blade!
Theon Greyjoy: I take orders from your father, not you.
Bran Stark: Please, Father!
Ned Stark: I'm sorry, Bran. 
Jon Snow: Lord Stark? There are five pups, one for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them. 
Ned Stark: You will train them yourselves, you will feed them yourselves, and if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
Bran Stark: What about you?
Jon Snow: I'm not a Stark. Get on.

Ned Stark: But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?
Robert Baratheon: This Khal Drogo, it's said he has a hundred thousand men in his horde.
Ned Stark: Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert!
Robert Baratheon: There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me 'Usurper'. If a Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him!

Jon Snow: Why do you read so much?
Tyrion Lannister: Look at me and tell me what you see.
Jon Snow: Is this a trick?
Tyrion Lannister: What you see is a dwarf. If I had been born a peasant, they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years.
Jon Snow: Until your brother killed that King.
Tyrion Lannister: Yes. Until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King, and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part, for the honor of my House. Wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword, and I have my mind, and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much, Jon Snow. And you?  What's your story, bastard?  
Jon Snow: Ask me nicely, and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.

Jaime Lannister: I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.
Ned Stark: You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
Jaime Lannister: I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you, coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.
Ned Stark: But you just stood there and watched.
Jaime Lannister: Five hundred men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms, you think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. Five hundred men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later, when I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing, as your father burned. It felt like justice.
Ned Stark: Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

Ned Stark: Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
Petyr Baelish: Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.
Ned Stark: He broke the law. Betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?
Robert Baratheon: And if he's right?! If she has a son?! A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army! What then?!
Ned Stark: The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.

Varys: I understand your misgivings, my lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.
Grand Maester Pycelle: I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now, so that tens of thousands might live?

Robert Baratheon: Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move, only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all?!

Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.

Cersei Lannister: At first, just saying her name, even in private, felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you; as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it!

Lysa Arryn: [to Catelyn] The sky cells always break them. [to Tyrion] Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man.
Tyrion Lannister: Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated. Gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl, bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. [closes his eyes] If I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing.
[The crowd gasps]
Tyrion Lannister: When I was 10, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and...I escaped justice. When I was 12, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew.
[The crowd gasps again as Tyrion continues]
Tyrion Lannister: I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry [pantomimes with his hands as Lysa and Catelyn were not amused]...into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel⁠—
Lysa Arryn: Silence!
Robin Arryn: What happened next?
Lysa Arryn: What do you think you're doing?
Tyrion Lannister:  Confessing my crimes.
Catelyn Stark: Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband ⁠— Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.
Tyrion Lannister:  Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that.
Lysa Arryn:⁠ You've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell...with a steeper floor.
Tyrion Lannister: Is this how justice is done in the Vale? You accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the king's justice? I am accused and demand a trial!
[The crowd murmurs in agreement]
Lysa Arryn: If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life.
Tyrion Lannister: I understand the law.
Lysa Arryn: We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. [to guards] Open the Moon Door.
[The guards turn at the wheel to uncover an open floor beneath as Robin claps and giggles in delight.]
Lysa Arryn: You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgment. Then you will leave...by one door or the other.
Tyrion Lannister: No need to bother, Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
[The crowd chuckles in disbelief]
Lysa Arryn: You have that right.
Arryn Soldier #1: My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.
Arryn Soldier #2: The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband, let me avenge his death.
Arryn Soldier #3: I'll fight for you, my lady.
Arryn Soldier #4: It'll be my honor.
Arryn Soldier #5: The honor should be mine.
Robin Arryn: Make the bad man fly!!
Lysa Arryn: [sees someone who remained silent] Ser Vardis, you're quiet. Don't you want to avenge my husband?
Ser Vardis: [bends in one knee] With all my heart, my lady. [observes Tyrion] But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
Tyrion Lannister: Agreed.
Lysa Arryn: You demanded a trial by combat.
Tyrion Lannister: Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.
Ser Vardis: [Stands up] My lady, I will gladly fight the Imp's champion...for you.
[Lysa nods in approval.]
Tyrion Lannister: I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.
Lysa Arryn: The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
Tyrion Lannister: Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.
Lysa Arryn: [Shakes her head] The trial will be today.
Tyrion Lannister: [Turns to the crowd] Do I have a volunteer? Anyone? Anyone?
Lysa Arryn: I think we can assume that no one is willing⁠—
Bronn: [Steps in] I'll stand for the dwarf.
[Tyrion is surprised at this gesture while Bronn shrugs in return.]

Ned Stark: What? No.
Sansa Stark: Please father, please! Please don't!
Arya Stark: You can't! I've got my lessons with Syrio! I'm finally getting good!
Ned Stark: This isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
Arya Stark: Can't we take Syrio back with us. 
Sansa Stark Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go! I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey! I love him! And I'm meant to be his queen and have his babies!
Arya Stark: Seven hells!
Ned Stark: When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who is worthy of you. Someone who is brave and gentle and strong.
Sansa Stark: I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him. [Arya and Ned exchange an amused look at Sansa’s inadvertent characterization of Joffrey.] He'll be the greatest king there ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
[A look of realization spreads across Ned's face after listening to the last part of Sansa's statement.]
Arya Stark: The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag like his father. 
Sansa Stark: He is not! He is nothing like that old, drunk king.
Ned Stark: Go on, girls. Get your septas and start packing your things.
Sansa Stark: Wait!
Arya Stark: Come on!
Sansa Stark: But it's not fair!

Khal Drogo: Qora mae.

Viserys Targaryen: No, Dany. Dany, tell them. Make them! Dany, make them. No, you can't! Just please! Dany, please! 
Khal Drogo: A crown for a king.

Jaime Lannister: [Reading] "You are summoned to answer for the crimes of your bannerman, Gregor Clegane 'the Mountain'...er, arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown." Poor Ned Stark. Brave man, terrible judgment.
Tywin Lannister: Attacking him was stupid. Lannisters don't act like fools. Are you gonna say something clever? Go on!  Say something clever.
Jaime Lannister: Catelyn Stark took my brother.
Tywin Lannister: Why is he still alive? 
Jaime Lannister: Tyrion?
Tywin Lannister: Ned Stark.
Jaime Lannister: One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
Tywin Lannister: Why is he still alive? 
Jaime Lannister: It wouldn't have been clean.
Tywin Lannister: Clean? You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
Jaime Lannister: I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
Tywin Lannister: No, that's what you want people to think of you.
Jaime Lannister: It's the truth.
Tywin Lannister: When you hear them whispering "Kingslayer" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?
Jaime Lannister: Of course it bothers me.
: Tywin Lannister: The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep. I suppose I should be grateful your vanity got in the way of your recklessness. I'm giving you half of our forces. Thirty-thousand men. You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts!
: Jaime Lannister: I didn't know you put such a high value on my brother's life.
: Tywin Lannister:  He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he is one of us. And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.
: Jaime Lannister: So, the lion does concern himself with the opinions of the-
: Tywin Lannister: No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!  If another house can seize one of our own, and hold him captive with impunity, it means we're no longer a house to be feared! Your mother's dead, before long I'll be dead, and you and your brother and  your sister and all of her children. All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground. It's the family name that lives on. It's all that lives on. Not your honor, not your personal glory, family. Do you understand? You're blessed with abilities that few men possess. You're blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the Kingdoms, and you're still blessed with youth. And what have you done with these blessings, hmm? You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings, one a madman, the other a drunk. The future of our family will be determined in these next few months. We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years...or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did. I need you to become the man you were always meant to be.

Cersei Lannister: Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you call me here, to pose me riddles?
Ned Stark: [gesturing to the bruise on Cersei's cheek] Has he done this before?
Cersei Lannister: Jaime would have killed him. My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
Ned Stark: Your brother? Or your lover?
Cersei Lannister: The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for three hundred years to keep bloodlines pure. Jaime and I are more than brother and sister; we shared a womb, came into this world together &ndash; we belong together.
Ned Stark: My son saw you with him.
Cersei Lannister: Do you love your children?
Ned Stark: With all my heart.
Cersei Lannister: No more than I love mine.
Ned Stark: And they're all Jaime's.
Cersei Lannister: Thank the gods. In the rare event Robert leaves his whores long enough to stumble drunken into my bed, I finish him off in other ways. In the morning, he doesn't remember.
Ned Stark: You've always hated him!
Cersei Lannister: Hated him? I worshipped him! Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath. And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the  Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life. And that night, he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine, and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, "Lyanna". Your sister was a corpse, I was a living girl, and he loved her more than me!
Ned Stark: When the king returns from his hunt, I will tell him the truth. You must be gone by then, you and your children; I won't have their blood on my hands. Go as far away as you can with as many men as you can, because wherever you go, Robert's wrath will follow you.
Cersei Lannister: And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself. Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell. He was sitting on the Iron Throne, and you made him give it up. All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself &hellip; such a sad mistake.
Ned Stark: I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.
Cersei Lannister: Oh, but it was. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.

Ned Stark: He did.
Renly Baratheon: She won't care. Give me an hour, and I can put a hundred swords at your command.
Ned Stark: And what should I do with a hundred swords?
Renly Baratheon: Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps! We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody; Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the king holds the kingdom. Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare; by the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us!
Ned Stark: And what about Stannis?
Renly Baratheon: [incredulous] Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?! You have odd notions about protecting the realm!
Ned Stark: Stannis is your older brother-
Renly Baratheon: This isn't about the bloody line of succession! That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King, it shouldn't matter now! What's best for the Kingdoms? What's best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is; he inspires no love or loyalty. He's not a king...I am.
Ned Stark: Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice, he destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
Renly Baratheon: Yes, he's a good soldier, everyone knows that; so was Robert! Tell me something, do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?

Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
Ned Stark: What of my daughters?
Varys: The younger one seems to have escaped the castle. Even my little birds cannot find her.
Ned Stark: And Sansa?
Varys: Still engaged to Joffrey. Cersei will keep her close. The rest of your household though, all dead, it grieves me to say. I do so hate the sight of blood. 
Ned Stark: You watched my men being slaughtered, and did nothing.
Varys: And would again, my Lord. I was unarmed, unarmored, and surrounded by Lannister swords. When you look at me, do you see a hero? What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learnt the truth about Joffrey's birth?
Ned Stark: The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.
Varys: Ahh, the children. It's always the innocents who suffer. It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar. Oh the wine slowed him down, and the boar ripped him open, yes, but it was your mercy that killed the King. I trust you know you're a dead man, Lord Eddard.  
Ned Stark: The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother. 
Varys: The wrong brother, sadly, and lost to her. Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.

Daenerys Targaryen: This is not God's work. My child was innocent!
Mirri Maz Duur: Innocent? He would have been the stallion who mounts the world. Now he will burn no cities, now his Khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
Daenerys Targaryen: I spoke for you. I saved you!
Mirri Maz Duur: Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you "saved" me, girl. I saw my God's house burn. There where I had healed men and women, beyond counting. In the streets, I saw piles of heads. The head of a baker, who bakes my bread. A head of a little boy that I cured of fever just three moons past. So, tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?
: Daenerys Targaryen: Your life!
: Mirri Maz Duur: Why don't you take a look at your Khal? Then you will see exactly what life is worth, when all the rest has gone.

Tywin Lannister: They have my son.
Tyrion Lannister: The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
Harys Swift: I'm told his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses!
Addam Marband: Is it true about Stannis and Renly?
Kevan Lannister: Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered...it's a catastrophe.  Perhaps we should sue for peace.
Tyrion Lannister: [Knocks his glass to the floor, shattering it] There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking out of that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning, in case you hadn't noticed.
Kevan Lannister: I'm told we still have his sisters...
Harys Swift:  The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime!
Addam Marband: No truces, we can't afford to look weak. We should march on them at once!
Kevan Lannister: First, we must return to Casterly Rock and raise more-
Tywin Lannister: THEY HAVE MY SON! Get out, all of you. [addressing Tyrion] Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark; if he were alive, we could've used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun... which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers, but now? Madness, madness and stupidity! I always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps I was wrong.
Tyrion Lannister: Half wrong. I'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.
Tywin Lannister: No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with five hundred riders and set the riverlands on fire from Gods' Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
Tyrion Lannister: And do what?
Tywin Lannister: Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead; you'll bring that boy-king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest, Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...
Tyrion Lannister: Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone?! Why me?
Tywin Lannister: You're my son. Oh, one more thing.  You will not take that whore to Court.

Greatjon Umber: My lords. MY LORDS! Here's what I say to these two kings. [Spits, drawing laughter from the men] Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the south? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong. Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead. [Draws his sword and points it to Robb] There sits the only King I mean to bend my knee to: the King in the North! 
Rickard Karstark: I'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their red castle, and their iron chair too. [draws his sword and kneels] The King in the North.
Theon Greyjoy: Am I your brother, now and always?
Robb Stark: Now and always, Theon.
Theon Greyjoy: [draws his sword and kneels] My sword is yours, in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.
Greatjon Umber: The King in the North!
Northern and Riverlords: The King in the North! [all drawing swords] The King in the North! THE KING IN THE NORTH!
