Meredith: [voiceover] In the practice of medicine, change is inevitable. New surgical techniques are created, procedures are updated, levels of expertise increase. Innovation is everything, nothing remains the same for long. We either adapt to change, or we get left behind.

Cristina: [to new interns] I have five rules. Memorize them. Rule number one, don't bother sucking up. I already hate you, that's not gonna change.

Alex: The first shift starts now and lasts 36 hours. You're grunts, nobodies, the bottom of the surgical food chain. You run labs, write orders, and you work every second night until you drop. And you don't complain.
Meredith: On call rooms. Sleep when you can, where you can. You know, but not with anybody. Not attendings, especially not attendings. Sleeping with attendings, not a good idea. Where was I?
George: Er, rule number three. If you're sleeping, do not wake you unless the patient's actually dying.
Cristina: The dying patient better not be dead when I get there, because not only will you have killed someone, you will have woken me for no good reason. Are we clear? [Lexie raises her hand] Yes?

Often, too often, things that start out as just a normal part of your life at some point cross the line to obsessive, compulsive, out of control.

Bailey: [to all the nurses who boycotted Mark's surgeries] This boycott has gone on long enough. Now, OK, I have no authority here, but I would like to offer my thoughts on Dr. Sloan.
Mark: [whispers to Miranda] You're doing great.
Miranda: Uh, this man is a whore, has always been a whore, will probably always be a whore. But, I mean, that's not a secret. He's not keeping it hidden. You all knew who he was before you got involved with him. And now you want to be all "woe is me, he doesn't call me back, he's dating other women." He's nasty, and that's not just you, he's sleeping with other doctors and orderlies and... cafeteria workers. But he's a doctor here and a pretty good one. So let us all close our knees and get back to our jobs so he can get back to his job and help the people that really need it.

Mark: The most refined, professional, lady-like doctor in this hospital came to my defense tonight. Best she could come up with was "he's a whore." [looks at Derek forlornly] I'm a whore.
Derek: I slept with her [Rose]. The whole time, I was thinking about Meredith. Who's the bigger whore?

Meredith: [voiceover]: It was a good day. Maybe even a great day. I was a good doctor, even when it was hard, I was the me in my head. There was a moment when I thought I can't do this, I can't do this alone. But I closed my eyes and imagined myself doing it, and I did, I blocked out the fear, and I did it.

Meredith: [voiceover] The problem with being a resident is you feel crazy all the time. You haven't slept in years. You spend everyday with people in massive crisis. You lose your ability to judge what's normal, in yourself or anyone else. And yet people are constantly asking you to tell them how they're doing. How the hell are you supposed to know? You don't even know how you're doing.

Lexie: I don't know how you get up in the morning, I honestly don't. Our dad abandoned you. And your mom by all accounts was the meanest person ever and you can't let Derek love you and it all really, really sucks. But ever since I knew you existed I had this fantasy about my big sister and you have failed, on every occasion to live up to that fantasy. But I still love you, whether you are capable of letting me or not. So, I forgive you. [storms out of bathroom]
Dr. Wyatt: [comes out of bathroom stall] Two o'clock work for you?
Meredith: Yeah... okay.

Dr. Wyatt: Was your life not working when you let that slip out from under you?
Meredith: Okay, when are you going to stop suggesting that I'm suicidal?
Dr. Wyatt: When you start acting like somebody that wants to be alive. 
Meredith: Give me my chart.
Dr. Wyatt: Why?
Meredith: Because I'm not suicidal, and if it says that, then it's wrong.
Dr. Wyatt: What happened last year when you fell in the water?
Meredith: I almost drowned. Do you think I did that for kicks?
Dr. Wyatt: You put your hand in a body cavity that contained unexploded ordinance.
Meredith: I was trying to save a patient!
Dr. Wyatt: Why is it that every other person in that room had the sense to hit the deck? You know, people run away from this line between life and death. You seem to stand on it and wait for a strong wind to sway you one way or the other. You're careless with your life. You're not slitting your wrists, but you're careless. Probably because your mother told you you were a waste of space on this planet. The problem is you believed her. And if you don't watch out, one of these days you're going to die because of it. 
Meredith: Hand me my chart. Now! And don't ever talk about my mother again.

Meredith: [voiceover] Don't wonder why people go crazy. Wonder why they don't. In the face of all we can lose in a day, in an instant, wonder what the hell it is that makes us hold it together.

Meredith[walks into Dr. Wyatt's office and sits down] My mom tried to kill herself, when I was a kid, after the love of her life disappeared. I never told anybody that before. Okay, so, you think I'm broken? Fix me. 'Cause I'm no quitter. Let's go!

Meredith: [voiceover] My mother used to say that for a surgeon a day without death is a rare gift. Every day we face death, every day we lose life. And every day we're hoping for a stay of execution. We are attached to death. Chained, like prisoners. Captives.

Mark: I tried to change, turn over a new leaf. But the leaf isn't turning. 
Webber: You weren't ready to change. And that's okay. Adele wanted me to change, to retire. Well, I'm still the chief and this weekend, I'm moving back home.
Derek: Does Adele know that? 
Webber: Oh, she'll be fine. She was wrong. I was right. And now we're––
Mark: Doing it like bunnies. [mutters to himself] I can't change. I can't change. I can't change.
Webber: Be who you are. I am who I am. A man.
Mark: A man. [Derek shakes his head in amusement] I have a way about me. A man who is who he is. I have a right to be that man.
Derek: [shakes his head] Tsk. I'm not gonna say anything. No judgement. [looks at Mark] The man you are: you slept with my wife. [looks at Richard] And you: you've been on my land for six months. But I've got no judgement.

Webber: [to Erica] Yang flew solo, you should be celebrating, because that means you're doing your job. Teaching her how to save a life. Residents are like puppies, eager and enthusiastic, and you need to learn how to teach without crushing their spirit. Now you want to work here with my residents, then you need to do better. You need to be a better teacher.

Adele: Richard...
Webber: I am a good man. I'm a good man. Look, I spend my days being a good man for the hospital, for my residents, for my patients. I'm a good man who made one mistake with a woman twenty years ago. And I'm a good man for everybody but you, I know that. Don't you think I know that? But I am a good man. And I am your husband. And I love you. Now I am not asking you to come home. I'm telling you. I am your husband. And I want to come home to my wife.

Adele: Well, it's about time.
