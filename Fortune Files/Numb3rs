: Amita Ramanujan: Actually, I'm spoken for, Mr. Eppes.
: Alan Eppes: Really?
: Amita Ramanujan: Back in Madras my parents arranged for marriage to a family friend. Nice Hindu banker from Goa.

: [Don and Charlie are arguing]
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: I'm going to go contemplate the koi pond.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: Please understand, sometimes I can't choose what I work on. I can't follow through on a line of thinking just because I want to, or &ndash; or because it's needed. I have to work on what's in my head. And right now, this is what's in my head.
<hr width="50%" />
: Don Eppes: I guess I was inspired by Mr. Heisenberg, just like Charlie here suggested.
: Alan Eppes: Heisenberg? What do you mean, the physicist?
: Don Eppes: Yeah.
: Alan Eppes: Oh. Your brother goes into a dangerous confrontation with heavily armed felons, and you prepare him with a lecture on the movement of subatomic particles.
: Charlie Eppes: I've gone months without leaving the house.

: Charlie Eppes: How do you forgive yourself if you're wrong?
: Don Eppes: You don't. We can't be wrong.

: Charlie Eppes: Larry, have a minute?
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Yes. Because we all have exactly the same number of minutes at all times, do we not?
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Let me ask one thing. When we met just now, was I coming or going in to the library?
: Charlie Eppes: Larry, you were coming out.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: [sighs] My memory is a memory. All right. [starts back inside]
: Charlie Eppes: [yells] Larry, you were coming out.
<hr width="50%" />
: Don Eppes: I mean, I'm just trying to get my head around the fact that my little brother consulted on an NSA issue that went high enough up for you to call the Assistant Director by his first name.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: One student even said I'm out of touch in cutting-edge thinking in multi-dimensional theory. That one alone kept me up at night.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: I once had a girl in my combinatorics seminar tell me that I was disorganized and I talked too fast.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: That's an accurate observation, actually.
<hr width="50%" />
: Don Eppes: Low-key and memorable aren't mutually exclusive. You know what my favorite date ever was? Pepperoni pizza in a Laundromat.
: Alan Eppes: Yes. Which explains the conspicuous absence of grandchildren.

: Security Guard: Excuse me, what are you doing?

: Charlie Eppes: Look, I think you'd be better off letting him do his job, because he's actually pretty good at it.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: What do you think we should do now?
: Don Eppes: The same thing when I was in school and I didn't know the answer &ndash; fake it.
: Charlie Eppes: It's not a code. It's a story told in numbers.
<hr width="50%" />
: Alan Eppes: Is that Amita sitting in the car out front?
: Charlie Eppes: Yeah. We just stopped by for a minute, so I can check this text on encryption and codebreaking.
: Alan Eppes: And you left Amita waiting in the car? No &hellip; no. This is not the way we treat people, Charlie. You bring her inside, you at least offer her something to drink. You know, like an adult.

: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Actually, it was incredible. It was primal. I mean, in the animal, not the numerical, sense. But what I'm saying, this was a perfect event, and, as such, untwinnable.
: Amita Ramanujan: So, because the sex was great, the odds are against it ever being great again.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: The replication defies the laws of probability.
: Amita Ramanujan: [dryly] So, why try?
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: [missing the sarcasm] Yes, yes. That's why I'm here. I mean, it's the perfect refuge.
: Charlie Eppes: What do you mean, "the perfect refuge"?
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Well, the math department must be the least libidinous place on campus.

: Alan Eppes: Well, it seems like your new math consultant is working out nicely.
: Don Eppes: I gotta tell you, dad, I can't think of anyone who could have helped us the way Charlie did in this investigation.
: Alan Eppes: You just remember how Charlie is. Can't seem to quit a problem. He's still working on the same one he's had since grade school.
: Don Eppes: And what's that?
: Alan Eppes: Trying to impress his big brother.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: Math is nature's language: its method of communicating directly with us. Everything is numbers.
: Don Eppes: A guy drops 70 bucks in a dive bar. He's either buying rounds for the house or else he's wasted off his ass. Either way, he's gonna stand out.

<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: It's like the evidence proves him right and wrong at the same time.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Oh yeah, the old paradox of Schrödinger's cat.
: Alan Eppes: Is that that Persian that keeps hiding out in our garage?
: Charlie Eppes: Uh-uh, it's an intellectual exercise.
: Alan Eppes: I knew that.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: You know, I've been running some numbers from your minor league days. I wanted to see which ones were the best pitches for you to go after.
: Don Eppes: Charlie, I don't like to think about it too much, all right?
: Charlie Eppes: Why not? If you can analyze your performance, you can improve it, Don.
: Don Eppes: Some things are about how it feels.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Children are wormholes. They're portals into the unreachable future and unattainable past. Well as .the things stand now, they exist only in the theoretical realms.
: Amita Ramanujan: Well.. I consider, you might have some trouble selling a woman the idea of carrying your wormhole.

: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Evaluating my immediate prospects for a conventional nuclear family, I've just now begun to consider adoption.
: Charlie Eppes: How long have you been considering that?

: Don Eppes: What, you didn't think I'd have a back-up plan?
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: In the first place, uh, we-we're not even sure that there, that there is a bomb, so &hellip;
: Alan Eppes: Bomb?
: Charlie Eppes: Well, we don't know where it's gonna go off.
: Alan Eppes: Well, maybe not, but I would suggest that people quickly taking a ride out of town in an easterly direction might be of help right now.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Well, possibly not with these current wind conditions.
<hr width="50%" />
: Don Eppes: Look, what you hear stays in this room.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
: Don Eppes: A truck carrying three casks of this stuff was hijacked this morning.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Oh, that's not optimal.
<hr width="50%" />
: Houser: We're fairly confident that hasn't happened yet.
: Don Eppes: You're fairly confident?
<hr width="50%" />
: Alan Eppes: Listen, Charlie, if you've got one failing, it's only that you don't think like a criminal &hellip; 'course, what does that say about me?
: Alan Eppes: I heard that, uh, Don was leaning towards the wife.
: Charlie Eppes: That's right.
: Alan Eppes: Seems to be the first place they look nowadays.
: Charlie Eppes: I don't understand. I mean, if you hate the person you're married to that much, get divorced.
: Alan Eppes: Even the thought of divorce holds its own special horrors, let me tell you.

: Don Eppes: Glad to see you're taking my advice and having some fun.
: Agent Cooper: We spent two weeks in a cemetery once, waiting for this guy to show up at his wife's grave. Grabbed him as he was putting a dozen roses on her headstone.
: David Sinclair: She died while he was in prison, huh?
: Agent Cooper: Just before he went. He's the one that killed her.

: Charlie Eppes: Coincidences are a mathematical reality. Statistically unlikely events can and often do occur. Just look at the genesis of our planet.

==Season 2==: [Talking about a girl with interest in Don]
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: You know, that term "dark matter" has always perplexed me. It fallaciously implies that the 95% of our universe that cannot be observed is some amorphous, eventless emptiness.
: Amita Ramanujan: I'm sorry?
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: I guess it's all too human. Instead of admitting to the present limits of our knowledge, we just declare things to be unknowable.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: We all use math every day: to predict weather, to tell time, to handle money. Math is more than formulas or equations; it's logic, it's rationality, it's using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.

: CIA Agent: [to Don] Yes, and your country thanks you. [sticks hand for shake]

: Charlie Eppes: You're rocketing into space, Larry. There's no downside in packing a lucky shirt.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Well, it's only six months, though I will be traveling two hundred and fifty miles above the Earth at eighteen thousand miles an hour. It's only a phone call away &hellip; albeit a very expensive phone call.
: Charlie Eppes: Hey &hellip; so, we're gonna be back sometime Sunday night.
: Alan Eppes: In time for dinner?
: Charlie Eppes: Well, it is a math conference at Stanford &hellip; so chances are we may be a little late.
<hr width="50%" />
: Don Eppes: What's he want with this little girl?
: Rachel: Most likely, his 73rd wife.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Millie Finch: This bull's got problems.
: Charlie Eppes: I gotta tell ya, from a mathematical standpoint the designs for this yacht are absolutley amazing. It almost has me thinking about getting back into my fluid dynamics work again.
: Alan Eppes: Oh. I mean, abandon your cognitive emergence theory.
: Charlie Eppes: I said "almost".
: Alan Eppes: Oh, good, because I remember the damage some of those fluid dynamics experiments did on the pond in the backyard.
: Charlie Eppes: Oh, all the koi lived.
: Don Eppes: Do you think I need help?
: Megan Reeves: I don't think they've made the person yet who doesn't.
<hr width="50%" />
: Don Eppes: [seeing Charlie in his tux] Nice. Very &hellip; ah &hellip;
: Charlie Eppes: James Bond?
: Colby Granger: No.
: Charlie Eppes: Yeah, no, I didn't think so either.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Mildred Finch: In Antarctica we were used to doing everything very quietly. It's like a big library &hellip; with penguins.
<hr width="50%" />
: Alan Eppes: You save all the dirty jobs for yourself.
: Don Eppes: I do what has to be done &ndash; it's not like I like doing the dirty work.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: Since when did you become my conscience?
: Amita Ramanujan: Around the same time we started making out.
: Amita Ramanujan: Byzantines fighting side by side with Cowboys and Indians?
: Charlie Eppes: I had an imaginative childhood.
: Charlie Eppes: [showing his laptop monitor to David and Colby] Now, this is Professor Stanley Novich, and this is where the door to his lab used to be.
: David Sinclair: What do you mean, "used to be"?
: Charlie Eppes: I had one of my Dad's contractor friends bring in a crew last night. They drywalled his doorway, they painted it to match the wall. [sniggers]
<hr width="50%" />
: David Sinclair: The dude has always made me crazy. Ever know anyone like that?
: Don Eppes: Well, you know Charlie, right?
: William Bradford: You want to feel better? Take a pill. You want to get right? Face the truth.
<hr width="50%" />
: William Bradford: Coffee?
: Don Eppes: Ah, yeah. Er, no. Yeah, sure.
: William Bradford: Maybe decaf.
<hr width="50%" />
: Don Eppes: [to Bradford, screaming] I'm their boss. It's not my job to trust them, it's their job to trust me!
<hr width="50%" />
: Colby Granger: Good thing I stretched this morning.
: Che Lobo: What are you doing?
: Colby Granger: If you show up at the drop, he's gonna kill you. If I show up, at least there's a chance he'll settle for the money
: Che Lobo: Maybe he'll kill you too.
: Colby Granger: I know, doesn't seem fair does it? [Colby starts running with duffel bag of cash]
: Alan Eppes: Great! Now I have two jaded, world-weary sons!
: Don Eppes: And this one's got a shrink to prove it.
<hr width="50%" />
: Oswald Kittner: Unless there's a self-perpetuating element involved, like, er, nano-technology. Okay, you know when you stack up champagne glasses and fill them with champagne. You only pour the champagne into the top glass, and then it overflows to the others. It requires resources applied in one location, then it spreads.
: Alan Eppes: Oh, good God, another one?
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: Hey, do me a favour. Go find Dr. Finch. Tell her we need a priority run on the super computer, and, you know, be convincing.
: Oswald Kittner: I'll tell her the fate of democracy's at stake.
: Charlie Eppes: I like that.
: Don Eppes: Yeah, relax, you got the fifth best shot in the country covering your ass.
: Ian Edgerton: [relaxes his hand and makes his hands shake] Hey, fourth. You don't wanna ask how I moved up one spot.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: I can't believe it. Right in the middle of my lecture!
: Alan Eppes: Charlie, I'm as embarrassed as you are.
: Charlie Eppes: You were snoring!
<hr width="50%" />
: Ian Edgerton: [after threading a kill shot through two closed pickup truck cab windows and a suspect's skull] That oughtta move me up to number three.
<hr width="50%" />
: [Suspect runs out of apartment building and jumps in car]
: Ian Edgerton: [taps on window with a gun] Bet I can pull the trigger before you hit the gas.
: Charlie Eppes: [reading from the Manifesto] When biotechnology creates a marketplace where genetic material, who we are, can be bought and sold like a slave in the block, there is no freedom there.
: Charlie Eppes: Are we all so bad down here?
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Beauty and fragility of life on Earth, it takes my breath away.
: Charlie Eppes: So what's your problem?
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: That I will habituate and lose the vision.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: I feel like I'm in some dream with the ghost Larry, and I just want to wake up and talk to the real guy.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Millie Finch: One small step for Larry, one giant leap for CalSci.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: [voicemail] Greetings, earth-bound homo sapiens, I am orbiting your lovely blue planet until Earth-year 2007. You may leave a message here, or simply call out to the heavens. I will be listening.
: Alan Eppes: That's why using the water system makes perfect sense. They don't need to spread the poison themselves, the city distribution system will do the work for them!
: William Bradford: You talk a lot about your work, but I want to go a little further. What else is in your life?
: Don Eppes: Wha' &hellip; that I'm a workaholic with commitment issues that has a hard time trusting people, isn't enough?
<hr width="50%" />
: Don Eppes: You were &hellip; actually walking home?
: Charlie Eppes: Well, yeah, 'cause once I &hellip; once I got to the road, it was pretty easy.
: Don Eppes: I mean, he's eight.
: Charlie Eppes: I like walking. You know, that's like &hellip; that's my sport. You got hockey, you got baseball. I walk.
: Don Eppes: Like &hellip; like speed walking?
: Charlie Eppes: No, like normal &hellip; you've never taken a walk?
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: Hey, how you doin', I'm Charlie.
: Sari Kinshasa: Sari Kinshasa.
: Alan Eppes: And I'm Alan.
: Sari Kinshasa: Hello. You're FBI agents?
: Charlie Eppes: I'm an FBI consultant.
: Alan Eppes: I'm an FBI &hellip; dad.
: Ashby: I'm a speed dial away from collapsing this bridge.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: So I am an FBI. You know, I work for the FBI.
: Woman: Can't you protect him?
: Charlie Eppes: Well, uh, actually, I'm a mathematician.
==Season 4==: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Charles, the monks do not appreciate FBI agents knocking on their doors, especially during the morning contemplation.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: Don, you have a big ego.
: Don Eppes: Thanks.
: Charlie Eppes: No, you have a ginormous ego.
: Don Eppes: Thanks.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: I know math is full of absolutes; unfortunately, the rest of the world isn't.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: You can contemplate silence, but you can never find it.
: Megan Reeves: It's hard to believe people line up to get into this place.
: David Sinclair: Lots more line up to get turned away. Don't ever say I don't take you to the hottest places.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Other things keep thinking me.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: [in reference to darts] Unfortunately, my bird keeps trying to nest in the hallway.
: Alan Eppes: Look at this workload of mine. How do these kids do it?
: Charlie Eppes: They're kids.
<hr width="50%" />
: David Sinclair: Manager says he's a model tenant. Quiet, pays his rent on time.
: Colby Granger: Yeah, and the Son of Sam's the Employee of the Month.
<hr width="50%" />
: Colby Granger: Not to diss his decorating sense, but I've definitely seen obsession done better.
: Charlie Eppes: You're right.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: About what?
<hr width="50%" />
: Don Eppes: I told you they got me seeing a therapist?
: Lt. Gary Walker: Who isn't these days?
<hr width="50%" />
: Lt. Gary Walker: I've gotten used to not understanding what the hell you're talking about.
: Charlie Eppes: It's great to see you too, Lieutenant.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: The two great adult influences in my life are heading off to blow up pumpkins.
<hr width="50%" />
: Lt. Gary Walker: Scotch always tastes better if someone else is buying.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: That page is blank.
: Charlie Eppes: Not after I sign it.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: I'm the only one here who has visitors. Even the vow of silence guys are grumbling.
: Amita Ramanujan: I got it! I stole his mojo bag!
: Charlie Eppes: [to Megan and Colby via phone] She just stole his mojo.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Charles, you look like someone just stole your chalk.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: I sense a big hairy "but" coming. Ooh, pardon my terrible pun.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: I know how to trap this guy.
: Colby Granger: Yeah? Does it involve your deceptive upper body strength?
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: I have the willpower of a field mouse!
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: But in that field you are a very popular mouse!
: Don Eppes: Let me ask you something not about this.
: David Sinclair: About Liz?
: Don Eppes: Yeah, how did you know?
: David Sinclair: You asked permission to ask.
<hr width="50%" />
: Amita Ramanujan: If we had a DTMF decoder &hellip; that's a Dual-tone multi-frequency. It's touchtone.
: David Sinclair: Why couldn't you have just said that to begin with?
: Amita Ramanujan: Yeah, but it wouldn't have been as much fun.
<hr width="50%" />
: David Sinclair: Any hunch from Charlie is like a hunch plus.
<hr width="50%" />
: Don Eppes: Megan's on a bit of a timeout.
: David Sinclair: Again?
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: Knocking on the door from 300 miles above Earth.
: David Sinclair: Well, we're about to knock a lot harder.
: Megan Reeves: Hugh Jackman in a Wolverine outfit. Now, that was hot.
<hr width="50%" />
: Ross Moore: Justice? Kid, you read too many comic books.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: Galactus? That's the guy who ate planets.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Yeah, but he was stellar Darwinism. He was necessary to the survival of the universe.
: Charlie Eppes: What?
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: He was the third four, along with eternity and death.
: Charlie Eppes: Larry, he wanted to eat the Earth.
<hr width="50%" />
: Megan Reeves: Naked carjacking. That's the worst kind.
<hr width="50%" />
: Alan Eppes: Charlie sees math as beautiful, and he wants everyone else to love it the way he does.
: Don Eppes: You gotta give up on this one, buddy.
: Charlie Eppes: I didn't get where I am by giving up on being right.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: He's Warspying.
: Liz Warner: Just when I'm convinced you can't come up with something new.
<hr width="50%" />
: Alan Eppes: What? So we'll just wait?
: Charlie Eppes: Until they need me.
: Alan Eppes: What are they gonna need you for?
: Charlie Eppes: There's always something.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: I failed. I failed to make myself understood. Sometimes there are things in my head that are so purely what they are that when I try to turn them into words, there either are no words, or I just don't know how. And you can't imagine how that feels. How hard it is to have an idea and not be able to share it. 
<hr width="50%" />
: Ben Blakely: It's the human urge to light up the dark corners for answers in other people…but at the end of the day, there are no answers there. Just more lives as sad and singular as our own.
: Charlie Eppes: There is nothing wrong with my driving.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: So the chorus of car horns that follows in your wake &hellip; what is that? A spontaneous phenomenon?
<hr width="50%" />
: Amita Ramanujan: Charlie, you really can't be too careful.
: Charlie Eppes: You're wrong. This is proof right here you can be too careful.
<hr width="50%" />
: Colby Granger: You can't just keep going around telling everybody you're fine.
: Charlie Eppes: Well, obviously, I'm not fine.
: Colby Granger: That's why you got to do something about it. It doesn't matter how scared you were. It doesn't matter if you wet your pants, man. There's nobody out here who's gonna hear it.
<hr width="50%" />
: Alan Eppes: Oh, come on, no. The house is fine &ndash; it's old, but it works &hellip; you know, mostly &hellip; I mean, it's a lot like me.
<hr width="50%" />
: Ray Galuski: No offense, but if you got to get a FBI bodyguard, why not get that hot one we worked with, Agent Reeves? Pretty sure she was diggin' me!
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: You know, actually, Ray &ndash; Agent Reeves &ndash; or Megan &ndash; and I, we're kind of involved.
: Ray Galuski: [laughs] &hellip; You're serious?
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Yeah, I am. And a little less incredulity on your part would be appreciated.
: Ray Galuski: No, Larry, sorry. It's just that how often do women like that get involved with guys like us? Nice going!
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Okay, well &ndash; thank you!
: Alan Eppes: They're having an all-night math-a-thon in the living room.
<hr width="50%" />
: Rapist: It's just sex, guys.
: Colby Granger: We'll see how you feel when you become someone's cell block bitch.
: Charlie Eppes: We're going to need dry-erase boards. Lots of dry-erase boards.
<hr width="50%" />
: [David asks Colby to climb up the trellis]
: Colby Granger: Yeah. Colby, go down the elevator shaft. Colby, jump in the bay. Hey, Colby, climb the Sixth Street Bridge.
: David Sinclair: I went out on the bridge with you, okay?
<hr width="50%" />
: David Sinclair: What's the deal with the waffles, man?
: Amita Ramanujan: I think it's Charlie's way of saying that your family is whoever you want to eat waffles with.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: That's a worthy sentiment.
: Megan Reeves: And one that's even better with syrup.
<hr width="50%" />
: David Sinclair: [talking to Colby] You, my friend, are a prisoner  of high standards and low social skills.
: Robin Brooks: You can be a real bastard sometimes.
: Don Eppes: Yeah! My shrink said something like that!
: Robin Brooks: This shrink &ndash; has he taught you how to say "I was wrong" yet?
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: When I'm stuck, I've always found the work pattern of a certain Englishman to be inspirational.
: Amita Ramanujan: Sir Isaac Newton?
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: No, Sherlock Holmes.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: According to my instructor, in the event of a firefight my best course of action is to get into a fetal position and call for my mama.
<hr width="50%" />
: Megan Reeves: At least it's not porn.
: David Sinclair: That would be Granger's computer.
: Colby Granger: Only on Saturday nights.
: Don Eppes: All right, so where is the "I told you so"?
: Liz Warner: You made the call you thought was right. It sucks being the boss. But you know what? It's not a democracy.
<hr width="50%" />
: Liz Warner: Okay, so you're thinking if Ferraro and Porter are trained to act in a certain way, we'll be able to predict what their next move will be?
: Colby Granger: Yeah. Maybe Charlie will be able to slap it into one of those algorithmic, geo-profiling, hot-zone hot-pocket deals.
: Don Eppes: Put it just like that when you ask him.
: Alan Eppes: [to Larry] Not everyone has the emotional and intellectual resource to search for God in a supercollider.
<hr width="50%" />
: David Sinclair: I hate to break this up, but I was about to pass out from the marker fumes.
: Amita Ramanujan: Ah, yes, that would be the lemon. I told you it was too much.
: Charlie Eppes: [sniffing the pen] I like it.
: David Sinclair: It smells like a urinal cake.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: Oh boy, that's the fourth security camera we passed since they buzzed us through the gate.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Extremist in Orwellian paranoia as well as stunted religious beliefs.
<hr width="50%" />
: M.E. Ridenhour: We all have normal levels of heavy metal like arsenic or mercury in our bodies. Hair shows abnormal dosages.
: David Sinclair: Even a year later?
: M.E. Ridenhour: They dug up Napoleon and it worked on him, so yeah, I think we still got a window here.
<hr width="50%" />
: David Sinclair: Was gonna wait for the fire department to get here, but, uh, Granger made me look bad by running in there.
: Don Eppes: Ah.
: Colby Granger: Right, the reluctant hero. Hey, at least you got to carry the girl.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Her parents were both schooled here. They raised her here. I'm sure they're very intelligent, cosmopolitan people.
: Charlie Eppes: They tried to arrange a marriage for her.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Yeah, that had slipped my mind.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: I haven't heard of any of these artists, and it's not like I've been living in a cave.
: Charlie Eppes: No, just a space station and a monastery &hellip; and &ndash; oh yeah! &ndash; the steam tunnels.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Point taken.
<hr width="50%" />
: Amita Ramanujan: I didn't say it was rational, it just feels weird.
: Charlie Eppes: My Dad knows you spend the night. That's never been weird.
: Alan Eppes: Well, it's weird now, thank you very much.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: Hey, Larry. How was the departmental breakfast?
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: It was less than stellar. I was running late, and the only available seat was next to Professor Heinslose.
: Charlie Eppes: The slurper.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: You know, all he had was the fruit plate, and he was deafening.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: I'm in!
: Alan Eppes: Oh yeah, you're in. But you must realise of course, that now you have to marry her.
: Charlie Eppes: [to Don] You and I have two very different [[world views, and that's fine. But now you're crossing into my world and making assumptions about how people like me can or should work.
<hr width="50%" />
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: I have to confess, this whole business of rearranging DNA to suit human needs, I find very exciting; in this rather &hellip; life-threatening, world-ending sort of way.
==Season 5==: Colby Granger: [to Ian Edgerton] "What are you doing here?"
: Ian Edgerton: "I caught up with an escaped convict in Riverside, tonight I fly out of LAX to Oslo, fugitive stockbroker."
: Colby Granger: "So you came down here to taunt us with your lack of availability?"
<hr width="50%" />
: Ian Edgerton: "I don't know if you guys need a tracker."
: David Sinclair: "A lot of innocent people up here, kids, families, hikers, puppies."
<hr width="50%" />
: Alan Eppes: "You know the first time my wife and I took charlie to the pediatrician for an earache, he wouldn't let the doctor examine his ear because he thought the doctor just might see the thinking in his head.  The doctor declared him the second most stubborn kid he'd ever met."
: Ian Edgerton: "and the first?"
Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: "Let me guess, Don?"
: Alan Eppes: "You got it."
<hr width="50%" />
: Ian Edgerton: [to man with rifle] "You might miss, I won't!"
: Alan Eppes: Listen, Charlie, when you're dealing with the Government, it doesn't hurt to have more than just the facts on your side.
<hr width="50%" />
: Nikki Betancourt: The perp fled in a brown truck,... flower truck or bread truck.
: Don Eppes: Stolen, right?
: Nikki Betancourt: Unless we're looking at a gang of rogue bakers.
: Charlie Eppes: I gotta go.
: Alan Eppes: Clearance or no clearance, he still knows how to make an exit.
<hr width="50%" />
: David Sinclair: [about Colby sleeping with a suspect] Screwing up is leaving your gun in the bathroom. This is messed up!
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie: You know, the LAPD is a fascinating organization; they invented SWAT, they invented community policing, the DARE program...
: Larry: Not to mention Dragnet, right?
: Charlie: Yeah, and you know, his badge number, 714? It's been retired, no officer can wear it.
: Larry: That's odd, that's the same number stamped on US-made Quaalude tablets.
: (awkward pause)
: Larry: It's not really relevant how I know that
: Girl: Will you take a picture of me and my friends?
: Liz Warner: No. But I'll take your camera.

<hr width="50%" />
: Colby Granger: Morning, sunshine. Are we Kelli Rand fans or what?

: David Sinclair: Check this out! Two men died for a truckload of empty boxes.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: This is one time the haystack is gonna tell us more than the needles.
: Larry Fleinhardt: We got thousands of trucks, millions of parcels, this is one large haystack Charlie!

: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: It brings out the worst in otherwise reasonable people.
<hr width="50%" />
: Nikki Betancourt: [seeing David on the news about a missing magician] Agent Harry Potter, first on the scene!
: Colby Granger: Thanks for running. Easier to tell who's guilty.

: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: [talking about the way Charlie is wearing his Neoprene suit] I'm fairly certain the zipper goes in back.
: Don Eppes: [to suspect] Watch your head.

: Don Eppes: [to Nikki] I don't want you doing stuff like that. I want you to be better than me.

: [Colby and David walk into a neighborhood being run by a criminal and everyone promptly goes into their homes]
: Colby Granger: Everybody knows our name, but nobody's glad we came.
<hr width="50%" />
: Charlie Eppes: It sounds like they created a classic [[game theory scenario, doesn't it?
: Marshell Pentfield: Yes, it does. "Johnny von Neumann", the old three man gunfight.
: Colby Granger: A mathematical gunfight, huh?
: Marshell Pentfield: Imagine a duel between three people. Now, I'm the worst shot. I hit the target once every three tries.
: [Indicates Charlie]
: Marshell Pentfield: One of my opponents is better. Hits it twice every three shots.
: [Indicates Colby]
: Marshell Pentfield: The third guy is a dead shot. He never misses. Now, each gets one shot. As the worst, I go first. Then Charlie, then Colby. Who do I aim for, for my one shot?
: Colby Granger: I guess me 'cause I'm the biggest danger, right?
: Marshell Pentfield: [makes a gun shooting motion toward Charlie] I shoot Eppsey first, but not for the obvious reasons. Chances are two to one I'm going to miss.
: Charlie Eppes: And now it's my turn. Logic says I shoot Colby. [makes shooting motion toward Colby]
: Colby Granger: Right, 'cause if I'm still standing, I'm gonna shoot you, and I don't miss.
: Charlie Eppes: Exactly.
: Marshell Pentfield: As the worst, I use the two better shooters against each other.
: Dr. Larry Fleinhardt: Within the small sphere of our lives we can stare into the past, but all we can really change is our future.

: Ugly Joe: [About three escapees from prison] Unless we hear reports about three badasses terrorizing the countryside in their underwear, count on a change of clothes, too.
: Bus driver: This is Hollywood! Watch your step! Breaking your leg here does not bring you any luck!
<hr width="50%" />
: Amita Ramanujan: [about Larry and Alan arguing] It's like this one time, when Bugs Bunny tricks Duffy Duck into declaring duck season, by declaring rabbit season. And then Elmer Fudd shoots Duffy Duck and his beak spin around. It's really very funny!
: Charlie Eppes: [to Amita] It's too quiet with my dad away, drop a spoon or something.
<hr width="50%" />
: Amita Ramanujan: Imagine Alan in high school. Hanging out by the bike racks, snapping towels in the shower.

: Nikki Betancourt: [after David opened a secret vault] How'd you do that?
: David Sinclair: It worked for Batman.

<hr width="50%" />
: Alan Eppes: Listen, when you're done with that, would you mind looking at something for me?
: Charlie Eppes: Yeah, sure, what is it?
: Alan Eppes: My profile. I'm joining Facebook... Well, I figured, since I'm back in college I might as well hook up with some old friends, maybe even find some new ones. People with similar interests as mine.
: Charlie Eppes: Interests in what? High School Musical?
: Liz Warner: Look at you, back in Narc training you didn't even drink and now you're the drug prince of L.A.!
: Cam: Why do you think we never hooked up back then?
: Liz Warner: I d... you were married!

: Coach: [about the "Granny shot" being more effective than the overhead shot] But there's something about that shot... it... it just doesn't look right.
: Charlie Eppes: Well Coach, that's the whole point of this thing. I mean, if we're gonna end CalSci's 15 year losing streak, we gotta find the best shot, not the shot that looks right.

: Amita Ramanujan: [about two usernames never being online at the same time] It's like Superman and Clark Kent, never at the same place at the same time.
: Charlie Eppes: The same person.
: Charlie Eppes: My first day at CalSci, I stood in this office, and Biederman sat right there and he gave me the onceover and asked: "Are you the Boygenius that everybody says you are?"
: Amita Ramanujan: And now Biederman is retired and you are the man... oh, pardon me... the Mangenuis!

Don: Dang. Nice digs. (chuckling) Well, I don't understand. Dad said it was like a disaster, like my room when I was 15.
Charlie:  He was right, by the way. Um, no, Amita came by today and did all this. It's nice of her.
Don: You've definitely arrived, kid.
Charlie: Yeah. I've arrived. Don't know how long I'm set to stay.
Don: What are you talking about? You've been working for this your whole life.
Charlie: Yeah. My destiny. What if my future has changed, you know? What if it's not being an academic?
Don: What, you mean the FBI stuff? You don't seem to have a problem doing both.
Charlie: It's become increasingly difficult for me to be here in this bubble lecturing about set theory, knowing that there are real lives at risk, that there are real lives being lost out there.
Don: You know, Charlie, I've seen a lot of good agents burn out. You know, guys that just don't want to go home because they're afraid they'll miss something. What is... ( shuts scanner off ) I don't know about the whole destiny thing. You've had it pounded into your head since you were a kid. Why don't you just... do what you want on any given day? Okay? Just live a little.
Charlie: I don't know.
Don: Yeah, well, I do.
Amita: Hey. Am I interrupting something?
Don: No, I was just, uh, heading out, actually.
Amita: Good. 'Cause I need Charlie.
Don: All right. Congratulations. Uh, this is nicer than my apartment. See you later.

It all turns on a dime... and the things that matter... you don't wanna turn around and realise you've lost... while you were waiting. You know I love you so much...
: Amita Ramanujan: I love you too!
: Charlie Eppes: [goes down on one knee] Amita... will you marry me?
<!-- In this episode, Amita sends Charle a message by breaking into his bank and making fradulent charges on his credit: $275 for a snow globe, $3 for an indian tea set, 60 cents for a snowboard and 28 cent for an art deco mantel clock. Charlie came up that it was a "32 bit IPv4 address", 275.3.60.28. In networking, the highest value you can get is 255, with 256 combinations (0&ndash;255) in each octet. There are four fields separated by a period called an octet, 8 bits each, 32 in total. Hence, the value 275 is not a valid IP address for IPv4. -->

: Amita Ramanujan: Tal Feigenbaum is easily as good a hacker as Augie.
: Charlie Eppes: Yeah, he's probably trying to &hellip; decode the backdoor, too.
: Don Eppes: You know, what if he's not trying to hack Augie? I mean, what if he's trying to find him?
: Amita Ramanujan: IRC. Internet Relay Chat. It's how hackers talk when they don't want to be overheard.
: Charlie Eppes: It's a pretty primitive chat program.
: Amita Ramanujan: Think of it like shipping channels in the ocean. You can't see them until a boat cuts through the water leaving a wake. If two boats meet in the middle of the ocean to swap a load of illegal drugs, you have to catch them in real time, otherwise there's no evidence of the meeting left behind.
: Charlie Eppes: No names, no accounts, no records of exchange.
: Don Eppes: Well, how do they see each other?
: Amita Ramanujan: Online names.
: Don Eppes: Okay, so what, we've got "the_fist", and, and &hellip; what's Augie's?
: Amita Ramanujan: [points at the website] "00zemeister". I'll set up an alarm to alert us if either name enters an IRC channel.

: Amita Ramanujan: Okay. "I've got a surprise for you." "Funny, got one for you, too."
: Don Eppes: You got a trace?
: Charlie Eppes: Yeah, but they're probably bouncing around a hundred IPs. I mean, they'll be offline before we get a location.
: Amita Ramanujan: "We should meet." "Ha ha. Touch my system and it will eat your young." Okay, that was Augie.
: Don Eppes: Okay, so Feigenbaum wants to meet.
: Charlie Eppes: Augie's rewriting his code.

: Charlie Eppes: Scorpions! They got scorpions down there that sleep in peoples shoes. 
: Amita Ramanujan: So we'll wear sandals.
: Charlie Eppes: Very long flight.
: Amita Ramanujan: Not if we take separate planes. [Don enters]
: Amita Ramanujan: What do you think about Costa Rica? 
: Don Eppes: Ahm, I don't know. I hear they've got a lot of scorpions.
: David Sinclair: [on stakeout with the team] So are you saying, we're here on a hunch?
: Charlie Eppes: I wouldn't call it a hunch. It's a...

: Don Eppes: No! I'm thinking like golf, cigars... maybe Laguna or Torrey Pines.
