Beckett: You want to do something tonight?
Castle: Sure, if you want.
Beckett: Sure.
Castle: Like what?
Beckett: We could, um, go watch a movie.
Castle: Yeah, yeah, if you want to.
Beckett: Well, not if you don't want to.
Castle: Well if you want to, I - I want to.
Beckett: You know what, we've watched a lot of movies over the last couple of weeks.
Castle: Yeah.
Beckett: So maybe we could, you know, if you wanted...
Castle: If I wanted to what?
Beckett: I mean, we could try something else tonight.
Castle: Something else as in...
Beckett: Yeah. I mean, we haven't since...
Castle: Yeah, well, given everything that's happened, I thought you just, you weren't ready...
Beckett: I thought that you weren't ready.
Castle: I'm ready. I'm... I... [scoffs] I'm... I'm so ready.
Beckett: I'm ready too. Like, I'm really ready.
Castle: Okay, well, then, what are we waiting for?

Castle: I so missed these mind melds.
<hr width=50%>
Castle: You promise?
Beckett: Yes, we’ll pick up where we left off. I’ll even slip into that Valentine’s Day gift you got me.
Castle: You mean the one with...?
Beckett: Mmm hmm.
Castle: With...?
Beckett: Yep.
[Beckett walks into the crime scene and Castle leans heavily on the cop outside the door with a heavy exhalation.]

Beckett: Really? That's how the Devil is gonna kill someone? Using a broken pool stick?
Castle: Or perhaps the Prince of Darkness is trying to make a point. You live by the cue, you die by the cue.
Beckett: I thought he usually just released the hellhounds.
Castle: All right, then how do you explain what we just saw back there?
Beckett: Easy. Will didn't close the door all the way when he came back in. Our window was open, the killer came through it, and this huge gust of wind forced the door open,  and then shut when they left.
Castle: Except Will lives on the 19th floor. With no fire escape.
Beckett: Come on, Castle. You know that there are plenty of ways to access windows on high-level floors without a fire escape.
Castle: Yes. If you're Spider-Man.
Beckett: Our killer's not Spider-Man.
Castle: Agreed. Because it's the Devil.

Beckett: What would you do if you were attacked by an invisible, demonic force?
Castle: I'd tell Ryan to lay off the bean burritos at lunch
<hr width=50%>
Beckett: Give me a minute, and let me slip into something special, okay?
Castle: Right.
[as Beckett leaves, Castle hurries to the bed]
Castle: Cause there's something special I got you for Valentine's Day. I approve.
Beckett: It's even better.
[re-enters the room naked]
Beckett: It's invisible.

Jason: I’m not talking to Mr Castle. He’s a jerkface.

Castle: I realize you consider yourself the adult of the family...
Alexis: For good reason.
Castle: For very good reason. But... but part of being an adult is realizing you can't always protect the people you love.
Alexis: Okay.
Castle: Okay.
Alexis: Being an adult really sucks.
Castle: Yeah. And you've spent way too much time having to be one. So... [steps out and comes back in with a scooter] I'm ordering you to be a kid.
Alexis: Don't you think I'm a little old for that?
Castle: I am not too old for it, so you are definitely not too old for it.

Beckett: You think that you've won? You haven't. Everyone else has.
Adam: What do you mean, everyone else?
Beckett: Everyone who ever bullied you, who ever hurt you, belittled you, who ever thought you were weak and worthless and small. And you know what, Adam? They were right.
Adam: No they weren't. I am not any of those things.
Beckett: You're all of them, and worse.
Adam: [voice rising] I am what people made me.
Beckett: You were born this way, or your mummy made you. But Tim Witherspoon, and the rest of the kids at that school, they didn't break you. You were already broken. They only sensed what you were, and what you were about to become. So you know what? In a way, their bullying wasn't enough.
Adam: [close to tears] How can you say that? I'm the victim here.
Beckett: And you're always gonna be a victim. You think that hiding behind a username and killing is going to change that? That won't get you respect. You're always gonna be the same pathetic loser that...
Adam: [shouting] I am not a loser! 
Beckett: And when you abducted Kent and Warren, I bet the two of them looked at each other and thought, "Are we being punked here?"
Adam: Believe me, they didn't.
Beckett: They think it's a joke.
Adam: They're afraid, they're - they're terrified by...
Beckett: They're sharing a laugh right now about you.
Adam: They are not laughing! 
Castle: She just got him to say that they're together.
Beckett: They're laughing. They're laughing right now.
Adam: Well, not for long. That clock will count down to zero, and their screams will echo off the tiled walls as they take in their last breath of stale air, and then they'll both fry.
Garrett: Tiled walls and stale air? That was how he talked about the locker room at his school.
Castle: Where Witherspoon put him on the video. He's bringing this thing full circle! What was the name of that high school?
Garrett: Harding High. But they moved to a new campus. The original building is shut down.
Castle: [Hammers on screen] Beckett!

Ryan: You know, maybe that's what I need. A catchphrase. [With a gravel voice] "Time to mete out justice." "Time for prison time."

Castle: This coming from the woman who skipped prom to crash a poetry slam.
Beckett: Spoken word, Castle. That's a totally different jam. I mean, I could write a haiku for you instead.
Castle: No, that's against the rules.

Dino Scarpella: I need to find out who did this to him
Castle: Don't take this the wrong way, Dino, but I think you already do know...
Dino Scarpella: It was not Christopher!
Castle: All the evidence says that it was.
Dino Scarpella: He was framed, he's innocent, when it comes to this anyway. I know, because I was with him.
Castle: Dino, if that's true, all you need is to call Beckett. You can alibi him.
Dino Scarpella: Hmm, no, that's no good. See, at the time, me and Christopher, we were, uhm, engaged in a sensitive business transaction....

Castle: This isn't about me, is it? No, it's about so much more than that. This is about you, your inadequacy. All the games, all the manipulation. After I screwed up your plans, you needed to prove you were smarter than me. You needed to know you could control me.
Tyson: [Shrugs] Well, you're here.
Castle: You know, I've written characters like you. Cunning psychopaths so narcissistic they believe they can't be caught because they're smarter than everyone, and they need to prove it. That's your story, Jerry. Why you did everything. You needed to prove it. So I let you.
Tyson: What do you mean?
Castle: I let you bring me here. It was the only way to find you. I needed to find you so I could find her. But the truth, Jerry... the truth is, I lured you here, to watch you die. [In a deeper voice] Are we clear?
