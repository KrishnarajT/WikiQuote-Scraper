Castle: You do know how this works, right?

Castle Kate, I'm not proposing to you to you to keep you here, or because I'm afraid I'm gonna lose you. I'm proposing because I can't imagine my life without you. If that means when things get difficult we have to figure them out, then I'm willing to figure them out. Assuming you're willing to figure them out with me.

Esposito If your hero’s fictional cop buddies are anything like your real   cop buddies, then they’d have real work to get back to. So, bye bye now.

Castle Would make it easier to see you.
Beckett Not if I was in jail.
Castle Right.

Beckett Thank you, for not saying anything about Castle.
McCord Look, when I was a year out of Quantico, I was busting my ass on this case, my first big chance. We'd been going at it straight for a month, and I really wanted to let off some steam, so I went to a bar, and I picked up a guy, and I took him home. Next morning he says, "Who's Scofield?" Scofield was the subject of our highly classified investigation.
Beckett You talked in your sleep.
McCord That's this job. Things happen. You better make sure they only happen once.

McCord You know what the hardest thing about this job is?
Beckett What?
McCord Knowing when to stop doing this job.

Beckett Yeah, well that was Castle.
McCord But you were smart enough to act on it. That was your call

Ryan You don't need to. Not when you can go directly to the source.
Esposito Get Beckett to give us the lowdown.
Castle Okay, wait a minute...

Beckett [Taking the cup] Yeah, you are a tool, all right. Wow.
Castle So, uh, she's not here right now, so what's the harm in giving me a little tidbit?

Beckett:  No, Castle, I'm talking about my life.  I don't know what to do about my life.  I haven't been out of work since I was 15.  I cannot believe that the FBI fired me, and I can't get my job back at the NYPD because of the commissioner's stupid hiring freeze.  I might as well just apply to become a mall cop.

Doyle Yeah, you know fascists control the power, trying to control the world's energy supply for a select few - don't worry, we defeat them - turns out, that one of these new sources of power is a tachyon generator as it opens doors in time-stream continuum, allowing us to travel back in time! But of course because of the possibilty of abuse, it was technically regulated against, secret from the public...
Beckett  We have a witness that saw you leaving Shauna Taylor's apartment shortly after she was killed...
Doyle I'm getting to that - look, I'm a temporal anthropologist. What we do is travel back in time and we study culturally significant eras - ancient Egypt, middle ages, man I've been to Nazi Germany!
Castle Aren't you worried about the Butterfly Effect, a slightly change in something in the past thus altering the future?
Doyle No, we're careful. The timestream is mostly self-correcting, you know? Any small changes like a little ripple [...] [snipping his fingers] doesn't matter, but if someone wants do do something big, if someonebody wants to do something massive, then yes, of course, you're damn right you can change the future!

They were winning, until Deschile! He and his team they, they created an energy shield which was able to stop their weapons and completely turn the tide! Detective, listen to me! Ward is still obviously fighting for the fascists! They're trying to win the war by re-writing history! If he kills Deschile, there will be no energy shield, and without that energy shield, we lose that war! Ward's gonna kill Deschile, and that is why billions of people die!

She's not that into him and she steals the diamond, having no idea its real value. She smuggles it back to the United States and finds she can't sell it without attracting too much attention, so she hides it.

Alexis And he doesn't deserve it. He hasn't done anything wrong. It-Oh! And then there's my dad. What do I tell him, huh? That he was right all along? That I wasn't ready? [Gives a forced laugh]
Mandy [sighing] I wish I would've said that. I wasn't ready for soooo many things.
Alexis Do you ever look back on something you've done, and it's like someone else is doing it?
Mandy You're kidding, right?
Alexis Right. [sighs] Sorry, I...haven't had anyone to talk to.
Mandy Clearly

Esposito: Hey Castle, looks like your lovelife made the paper again...
Castle: Ah, what? Alright, alright, who am I gonna hook up with now?
Ryan: [Reading an article in the paper] Novelist Richard Castle and New York Police detective Katherine Beckett, both native New Yorkers, are pleased to announce their engagement.
Castle: No, nah, nonononono, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't do this...
Beckett: [Coming forward] Actually, I did.
Castle: I thought you...
Beckett: I know Castle, I like my privacy, but I do realize that you're somewhat famous...
Castle: [Indignantly] Somewhat?
[Ryan and Esposito make the "little" gesture]
Beckett: Yes, and if we're gonna be together, I have to come to terms with that. And if they're gonna write about you, I want it to be the truth, I want it to be about us. [Hugging Castle]
Castle: Well, there's no one that... [Esposito and Ryan grinning in the background, waiting for Castle and Beckett to kiss, Castle giving them the looks, they turn away] There's no one I'd rather share a headline with, but just for the interest of accuracy, let's see if we are getting married in space?
Beckett: No, it's not gonna happen babe...
Castle: [looking disappointed] Be pretty fun, space...

Castle Mother, what are you trying to force on my lovely fiancée?
Martha No, no, no, no, no. I am just trying to  expose Katherine to the glorious world of wedding magazines.
Beckett They are all very girly, with a lot of gauzy photos of love-struck brides looking off into the distance.
Castle Perhaps they're contemplating the 50% divorce rate.

Ryan ...but I did find out about our victim through his personal website.
Beckett He's got his own website?
Ryan Yeah, he's an actor. A struggling one, judging by his credits.
Castle Justin Marquette is "a member of the Roster Theater Company" and is "currently appearing in their off-off-off-Broadway production of Checkhov's Platonov." That's a lot of "offs."

[As the group is still in confusion about the case]
Esposito [To Castle] Alright. Come on.
Castle Hmm?
Esposito Give us one of your theories, bro. Come on. Whatever it is, it can't be any crazier than what we're already dealing with.
Castle Okay. I think...I'm man enough to admit I'm completely theory-less.
<hr width=50%>
Castle: What if their lives intersect, just not in such a literal sense?
Beckett: Castle, no, please. If this is some alternate universe theory, I'm not in the mood.
Castle: Really. Alternate universe, that's how little you think of me.
Beckett: I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry, I just, I thought that...
Castle: No, they're psychically linked, and not just to each other, but to the actual killer. See, they've seen the crime through his or her eyes, and the experience is so visceral that both Sam and Anita think that they committed the crime themselves.
Beckett: [giggles] I'm sorry, it's just you got excited, it's kind of cute.
Castle: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know how I like the weird stuff.
<hr width=50%>
Beckett: Tell me what this is all about.
Castle: Not until I know I'm right. Which... I am. You should know, you're engaged to a genius.
Beckett: Yes, a genius at annoying me.
Castle So, I'm Justin, and you are one of these several people who shot me.
Beckett I'm starting to feel the urge

Beckett: If I have to hear that confession one more time, I'm gonna shoot somebody.

Castle: It looks like she was stabbed with a knife.
Perlmutter: To the untrained eye, perhaps, but what you don't know about post-mortem analysis could fill a book, Mr. Castle. In fact, it has. Numerous times.
Castle Fine. So, it was not a knife.
Pearlmutter Ah, wrong again. It was a knife, but "stabbed" implies the blade was thrust into the victim, whereas this wound was produced by it being hurled into her chest.
Beckett What is this, Last of the Mohicans?

Castle: I was about to make that phone call, and that's when the ninjas attacked!

At the time, Elizabeth was closing in on a heroin ring in East New York and they had an undercover inside. His testimony was key to the case, but...
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett: He was dirty?
:<div align="justify">Victoria Gates: He'd skimmed a few eight balls off the very bust Elizabeth was building her case around. And when my office caught him reselling it, she came to me, begged me not to file charges. Asked me to think of the greater good. I did my job that day, too. Hasn't been the same between us since.

Martha That is quite an accomplishment, young lady. Nobody beats him, ever.
