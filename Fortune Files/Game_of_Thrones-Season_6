Ranger: Who killed him?
Alliser Thorne: I did. And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck, and the other officers in this castle.
Ranger: Murderers!
Ranger: Traitors!
[The rangers shout and argue amongst each other again]
Alliser Thorne: [pounds table again] Alright! We've committed treason, all of us! Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. I had no love for him, that was no secret. But I never once disobeyed an order. Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night's Watch is built and the Watch means everything to me. I have given my life - we've all given our lives - to the Night's Watch. Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night's Watch. He led the wildlings through our gates as no Lord Commander has ever done before. He gave them the very lands on which they reaved and raped and murdered. Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I've no doubt about that. And what he thought was right would have been the end of us. He thrust a terrible choice upon us...and we made it.

Jaime Lannister: You're a bold man. 
High Sparrow: On the contrary. I fear a great deal. The Father, the Mother, the Warrior. Do you know why we use these stones? To remind us not to fear death. We close our eyes on this world and open them in the next. 
Jaime Lannister: You must long for the next life. 
High Sparrow: [chuckles] In truth, I fear that too. 
Jaime Lannister: You imprisoned and humiliated my sister! 
High Sparrow: Your sister sought the gods' mercy and atoned for her sin. 
Jaime Lannister: What about my sins? I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back. I killed my own cousin. When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape that justice. What atonement do I deserve. 
[He puts his hand on his sword]
High Sparrow: You would spill blood in this holy place?
Jaime Lannister: The gods won't mind. They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined. 
High Sparrow: Go on then. I deserve it. We all do. We are weak, vain creatures. We live only by the mother's mercy.

Ramsay Bolton: My father was poisoned by our enemies.
Smalljon Umber: Hmm.
Ramsay Bolton: Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?
Smalljon Umber: The bastard Jon Snow let an army of wildlings past the Wall. We're farther North than any of you fuckers. Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first. I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all me life. But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.
Ramsay Bolton: So now you've come seeking help.
Smalljon Umber: We need to help each other. The colder it gets, the farther south those goat fuckers will roam. Won't take 'em long to get here.
Ramsay Bolton: You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?
Smalljon Umber: If they got Jon Snow leading them, maybe. He knows this place better than we ever will.
Ramsay Bolton: Pledge your banners to House Bolton. Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North, and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends.

Ramsay Bolton: Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.
Smalljon Umber: I'm not doing that either.

Olenna Tyrell: My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What's left to work with?
Jaime Lannister: Cersei is the mother of the King. She has the King's ear and his trust. And, the King has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery, and Ser Loras.
Cersei Lannister: The High Sparrow seized power, knowing full well we'd bicker among ourselves, instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now, the future of the Seven Kingdoms rests in his dirty peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me but, before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes.

Kevan Lannister: The King has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow, or the Faith Militant- out of fear for the Queen's safety.
Jaime Lannister: You will take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Were you expressly forbidden from standing down?
Kevan Lannister: No. But, if the King should call...
Jaime Lannister: The whole thing will be over before anyone can call upon you to do anything.  When the High Sparrow's back in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the King will be angry at the outcome?

Yara Greyjoy: I'm glad you're here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be: to execute the man who killed my father.
Euron Greyjoy: I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge. I watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me. No one loved him, no one wanted to follow him, he led us into two wars we couldn't win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.

Euron Greyjoy: Bright idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it. I've been all over the world, I've seen more of it than all of you combined, and across the sea, there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to galavant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen, along with my big cock.
Yara Greyjoy: You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
Euron Greyjoy: I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn't born to be king. I paid the iron price. And here I stand.

High Sparrow: Lord Tyrell. Ser Jaime. 
Jaime Lannister: Sorry to interrupt. We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us, and we'll be on our way.
High Sparrow: I don't have the authority to give them to you. And you don't have the authority to take them. 
Jaime Lannister: I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, first of his name.
High Sparrow: The Gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.
Jaime Lannister: You've already insulted one Great House. It won't happen twice. Every last Sparrow will die before Margaery Tyrell walks down that street.
High Sparrow: To die in the service of the Gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But, there is no call for it today. There will be no Walk of Atonement. Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins, by bringing another into the true light of the Seven. 
[the Sparrows open the doors of the Sept, and King Tommen walks out followed by his Kingsguard, whose armor are now embossed with the Seven-pointed Star.]
High Sparrow: Together we announce a new age of harmony. A Holy alliance, between the Crown and the Faith.

Walder Frey: You've lost it?!
Walder Rivers: Yes father.
Walder Frey: It's a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is? You didn't lose Riverrun: you let the Blackfish take it from you!
Lothar Frey: He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
Walder Frey: You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. And when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn't find him! That's what it means to lose something! Now he's come back and taken Riverrun!
Walder Rivers: I don't think it's fair to blame us.
Walder Frey: For three hundred years, we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners! Not again! Riverrun is ours! Take it back!
Lothar Frey: We don't have the men!
Walder Frey: We've got ten times as many men as the damned Blackfish!
Walder Rivers: The Mallisters have risen against us, and the Blackwoods!
Lothar Frey: The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps!
Walder Rivers: Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year! [Furious, Walder Frey strikes his new child-bride]
Walder Frey: If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge! They're laughing at us! All across the Riverlands, right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us! I hear it in my sleep! I'm not dead yet -unfortunately for you! - and I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter! Take that castle back!
Lothar Frey: He'll never yield, Father.
Walder Frey: Oh, he'll yield. You'll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark's child in its whore mother's belly and you'll show him the knife you used to open his niece's throat. And you'll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place! His nephew. [The guards bring in a chained Edmure Tully] Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You're going home.

Jaime Lannister: You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or...
Brynden Tully: Or you'll kill Edmure? My nephew is marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
Jaime Lannister: It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
Brynden Tully: Hundreds of mine, thousands of yours...if you can breach the walls.
Jaime Lannister: We'll breach them and kill every last one of you, but if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor.
Brynden Tully: Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
Jaime Lannister: The war is over, Ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?
Brynden Tully: As long as I am standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?
Jaime Lannister: You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives! Why did you come treat with me?

Jon Snow: Lady Mormont.
Lyanna Mormont: Welcome to Bear Island.
Sansa Stark: I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my aunt Lyanna. They said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too.
Lyanna Mormont: I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb.
Jon Snow: I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward and...
Lyanna Mormont: I think we've had enough small talk. Why're you here?
Jon Snow: Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said...
Lyanna Mormont: I remember what it said. "Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."
Jon Snow: Robb is gone, but House Stark is not, and it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.
[A maester whispers in Lyanna's ear]
Lyanna Mormont: As far as I understand you're a Snow, and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I've heard conflicting reports.
Sansa Stark: I did what I had to do to survive, my lady, but I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.
Lyanna Mormont: If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.
Jon Snow: Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him.  Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that...
Lyanna Mormont: I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?
Davos Seaworth: If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel.
Lyanna Mormont: I don't know you. Ser...?
Davos Seaworth: Davos, my lady. Of House Seaworth.
[Lyanna turns to her maester]
Davos Seaworth: You needn't ask your maester about my house. It's rather new.
Lyanna Mormont: Alright, Ser Davos of House Seaworth.  How is it you understand how I feel?
Davos Seaworth: You never thought you'd find yourself in your position, being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler, and now I find myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war.
Lyanna Mormont: Go on, Ser Davos.
Davos Seaworth: Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew he had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead, and make no mistake, my lady: the dead are coming.
Lyanna Mormont: [to Jon] Is this true?
Jon Snow: [nods] Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men, I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
Davos Seaworth: As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided, and a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King.  You want to protect your people, my lady, I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together.
[The maester leans in to whisper, but Lyanna waves him off]
Lyanna Mormont: House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for a thousand years. We will not break faith today.
Jon Snow: Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?
[An advisor whispers in Lyanna's ear]
Lyanna Mormont: 62.
Jon Snow: 62?
Lyanna Mormont: We are not a large house, but we're a proud one, and every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of ten mainlanders.
Davos Seaworth: If they're half as ferocious as their Lady, the Boltons are doomed.

Jaime Lannister: The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. You...you have a child now, I've heard. A son, sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man.
Edmure Tully: A son I've never met, born of a wife I haven't seen since our first night together.
Jaime Lannister: You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realise; comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock, a tutor for your boy, with knights to train him to fight and to ride, and when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own.
Edmure Tully: Can you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you've massacred my family, kept me in a cell for years, stolen our lands!

Edmure Tully: Do you think I care who you admire and who you don't?
Jaime Lannister: Maybe not, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister.

Jaime Lannister: I'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was...
Edmure Tully: Don't talk about Cat!
Jaime Lannister: I'll talk about whomever I want. She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do. Catelyn and Cersei, it's a fierceness you don't often see. They'd do anything to protect their babies; start a war, burn cities to ash, free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
Edmure Tully: You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.
Jaime Lannister: That's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want, you can sneer, it doesn't matter. She needs me, and to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy...and I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me.

Daenerys Targaryen: My reign is just begun.
[Suddenly, Drogon flies over them, roaring. Dany climbs onto his back and they take off. Rhaegal and Viseryon join him flying over the attacking fleet]
Daenerys Targaryen: Dracarys.
[The three dragons attack a warship.]
Grey Worm: [addressing the Master's slave-guards, in Valyrian] You men have a choice: fight and die for the Masters, who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families. 
[after a brief pause, the guards drop their weapons and run away, leaving the shocked Masters surrounded by the Unsullied]
Tyrion Lannister: Thank you for the armada! Our Queen does love ships. Now... Last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. And, though our Queen does have a forgiving nature, this... cannot be forgiven. 
Missandei: Our Queen insists that one of you must die, as punishment for your crimes. 
Tyrion Lannister: It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it?  Other people dying.
[After a pause, Razdahl pushes Yezzan forward]
Razdahl mo Eraz: Him. He should die.
Third Master: Yes, him! 
Razdahl mo Eraz: He's not one of us, He's an outsider, low-born! He does not speak for us.
Yezzan zo Qaggaz: Please. [falls to his knees] Please.
[Grey Worm cuts the throats of the other two Masters, leaving Yezzan alive.]
Tyrion Lannister: Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution, or ideas about returning the slave-cities to their former glory...remind them what happened, when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.

[Jon Snow arranges for a parley with Ramsay Bolton outside Winterfell]
Jon Snow[to Sansa] You don't have to be here.
Sansa Stark: Yes I do.
Ramsay Bolton: My beloved wife. I have missed you terribly. [to Jon] Thank you, for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me. Surrender your army, and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch, I will pardon these treasonous Lords for betraying my House. Come, bastard. You don't have the men, you don't have the horses. And you don't have Winterfell! Why lead those poor souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your horse... and kneel. [smirks] I am a man of mercy.
Jon Snow: You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You, against me.
[After a pause, Ramsay starts to laugh]
Ramsay Bolton: I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked! Maybe you are that good, maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you, but I know that my army will beat yours. I have six thousand men, you have...what? Half that? Not even?
Jon Snow: [smiles] Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you, when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?
Ramsay Bolton: [to Sansa] He's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?
Sansa Stark: How do we know you have him? 
[Lord "Smalljon" Umber throws the head of Rickon's direwolf at Jon's feet.]
Ramsay Bolton: Now, if you want to sa––
Sansa Stark: You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. [the conviction in Sansa's voice momentarily stuns Ramsey] Sleep well. [she rides away]
Ramsay Bolton: [smiles] She's a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you're all fine-looking men. [laughs] My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days, they're ravenous! I wonder which parts they'll try first? Your eyes? Your balls! We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then... bastard.

Tyrion Lannister: Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. 'The height of nobility, a man of your stature, someone to look up to!' You're all making the same five or six jokes.
Theon Greyjoy: It was a long time ago.
Tyrion Lannister: It was! And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys, if things had been going well-
Theon Greyjoy: I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad, and worse.
Yara Greyjoy: And he paid for them.
Tyrion Lannister: Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated, I know, growing up at Winterfell, not knowing quite who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?
Daenerys Targaryen: You've brought us a hundred ships from the Iron Fleet, with men to sail them? In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the Throne of the Iron Islands?
Theon Greyjoy: Not my claim. [nods at Yara] Hers.
Daenerys Targaryen: And, what's wrong with you?
Theon Greyjoy: I'm not fit to rule.
Tyrion Lannister: We can agree upon that, at least.
Daenerys Targaryen: Has the Iron Islands ever had a Queen, before?
Yara Greyjoy: No more than Westeros. [Dany smiles approvingly]
Theon Greyjoy: Our uncle, Euron, returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from Yara. He would have murdered us, if we'd stayed.
Daenerys Targaryen: Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible King.
Yara Greyjoy: You and I have that in common.
Daenerys Targaryen: [nods] We do. And both murdered by a Usurper, as well. [to Tyrion] Will their ships be enough?
Tyrion Lannister: With the former Masters' fleet... Possibly. Barely. There are more than a hundred ships in the Iron Fleet.
Theon Greyjoy: There are, and Euron is building more. [to Dany] He's going to offer them to you.
Daenerys Targaryen: So why shouldn't I wait for him?
Theon Greyjoy: The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you...
Yara Greyjoy: "His big cock,"  I think, he said. Euron's offer is also one of marriage, you see. You wouldn't get one without the other.
Daenerys Targaryen: And, I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
Yara Greyjoy: I never demand, but, I'm up for anything, really.
[Daenerys smiles back at her, coyly]
Theon Greyjoy: He murdered our father, and would have murdered us. He'll murder you, as soon as you have what he wants.
Tyrion Lannister: [nods] The Seven Kingdoms.
Theon Greyjoy: All of them.
Daenerys Targaryen: And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?
Theon Greyjoy: Your ancestors defeated ours, took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
Daenerys Targaryen: And that's all?
Yara Greyjoy: We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two, who don't think a woman's fit to rule.
Daenerys Targaryen: [smiles] Reasonable. [Yara smiles back]
Tyrion Lannister: What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
Daenerys Targaryen: She's not demanding; she's asking. The others are free to ask, as well.  Our fathers were evil men, all of us, here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it. [to Yara] You will support my claim to the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding or raping.
Yara Greyjoy: That's our way of life.
Daenerys Targaryen: No more.
Yara Greyjoy: No more.

Ramsay Bolton: [in the kennels] Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I'll be staying now? [Sansa stares silently at him, and he shakes his head, smirking] No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That's all right. You can't kill me. I'm part of you now.
Sansa Stark: Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
[Sansa opens the doors of his hounds' kennels. One of them emerges from its cage, growling quietly, and approaches him]
Ramsay Bolton: My hounds will never harm me.
Sansa Stark: You haven't fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
Ramsay Bolton: They're loyal beasts.
Sansa Stark:  They were. Now, they're starving.
[Two more hounds emerge and come to sniff at his face]
Ramsay Bolton: [hisses] Sit. [the hound begins licking his bloody face hungrily] Down. Down! Down! Down! Down!
[Ramsay screams as his hounds begin devouring him face-first; Sansa walks away smiling]
