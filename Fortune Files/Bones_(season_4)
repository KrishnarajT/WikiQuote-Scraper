Wexler Inspector Pritchard, meet Dr. Brennan.
Pritchard Charming.
Wexler She’s exactly like me.
Pritchard Charming, tenacious, salacious, sophomoric, euphoric, noble, ignoble, fatuous, horrid, morbid, torpid and tedious.
Wexler Flattery will get you absolutely nowhere, Cate. So you found Portia Frampton?
Pritchard Well, the way we usually work, Ian, is I drag the bodies out of the Thames and you use your extraordinary capabilities to identify them.
Booth Bones! They're like the English version of me and you.

Booth Okay, news bulletin for ya, Bones. There's not a guy in this country who wouldn't want to have sex with you. Probably half the gay men... whoa, easy.

Pritchard Oh, I am not the jealous sort, and you're painfully naïve if you think my sex life was limited to Ian, as I’m sure yours was not.
Brennan But I didn’t sleep with Ian.
Pritchard You didn’t?
Brennan No.
Pritchard Why not? You obviously fancied each other.
Brennan Yes, I noted several physiological responses to his presence which can only be explained by sexual attraction.
Pritchard So why didn’t you sleep with him then?
Brennan  Because of Booth.
Pritchard Ohhh, you know, I suspected that you two might be more than just partners.
Brennan  Oh, no. That’s incorrect. Booth advised me not to sleep with Ian because Booth didn’t want me to be another notch on Ian’s bedpost.
Pritchard See, I rather saw it as climbing Everest. Of course it’s been done before but the experience is still breathtaking.
Brennan  You have a strong sexual appetite and you’re not hamstrung by social moralizing. I can empathize with that.
Pritchard Thank you.

Brennan Anthropologically, 83% of societies are polygamist.
Booth Now you sound French. Okay, look, being faithful is what separates us, you know, from the chimps.

Sweets Does it seem that your partnership provides a surrogate relationship, making it more difficult to form other bonds?
Brennan A surrogate relationship wouldn't necessarily be such a bad thing because then I could avoid the sting of rejection, which, however fleeting, is still uncomfortable.
Booth Right. Okay, look, I'm sorry. You know what? If Mark and Jason don't know how lucky they are, they don't deserve you in the first place.
Brennan No, relationships are temporary.
Booth No, that's not true, Bones, you're wrong, okay? There is someone for everyone, someone you're meant to spend the rest of your life with, all right? You just have to be open enough to see it, that's all.

Booth: Okay, yeah, I get it. You saw a whole lady's corpse when you were a little girl and you were fine.
Brennan: Yes. Although, for some reason that I do not understand, I kept staging my own death. Pretending that I drowned in the bathtub, faking electrical shock. It really freaked my parents out. And once, when Russ found me hanging, he had to go see the school psychologist.
Booth: [mildly sarcastic] But otherwise you were fine.
Brennan: [earnestly] Yeah.

Brennan: Well, it's not his fault! He's actually a very nice dog, [cooing to Ripley] aren't you? [to Booth] He reminds me of you.
Booth: Me?

[Brennan and Booth have just finished burying Ripley]
Brennan: On behalf of humankind and the universe, I'd like to apologize for what happened to Ripley. He was born a cute little puppy, and then the people who adopted him wanted to kill him because they were too stupid to realize that he would grow into a big dog.
Booth: That's good.
Brennan: Ripley was a good dog. He didn't want to fight, but he did it to please his master. And he didn't want to attack a human being, but he did it — to please his master. [holding back tears] You know, it wasn't Ripley's fault that his master was cruel and selfish. Like all dogs, Ripley only saw the good in people. Dogs are like that. People should take a lesson.

Booth: Sweets, what are you doing?

Brennan: Masturbatory aid.
Booth: Oh. Check the shoes.
Brennan: What?
Sweets: Good.
Brennan: He's not going to find it in the shoes. (Sweets holds up a photgraph) Do all boys keep their masturbatory aids in their shoes, or is that particular to you?

Angela: Do you love your parents?
Sweets: Yes.
Angela: But you don't live together anymore, does that mean your relationship with mom and dad was unsuccessful?

Cam: Okay, let's stick to [[relevant facts.
Vincent: The sockets have been ground down.
Cam: Okay, that could be useful. [looks expectantly at Vincent, who smiles but says nothing] Especially if you have an explanation.
Vincent: Plastic surgery. Oh, she had [gestures with his hands in front of his chest] fake boobs, too.
Cam: "Sockets," "eyeballs," "boobs" — I wouldn't use these words when conferring with Dr. Brennan.
Vincent: I know.  With her it's all "supraorbital nimbus" and "mammary implants." But you seemed a more colloquial sort.

Vincent: Mmm-hmm. Triangular pubis, no evidence of a ventral arc. The pelvic bone speaks. It says, "I be male."

Brennan: Well, it's all about proximity to forensic evidence.
Max: Uh, don't take any offense, but that's a lot of crap. It's about a proximity to me. Right?

Wyatt: He most definitely is not fine. I've read his book.
Brennan: Wait, did he say something mean about us?
Wyatt: On the contrary. You might as well know that he lost both his adoptive parents just before he came to work for your de facto crime fighting unit.
Booth: What are we, the land of misfit toys?
Wyatt: He's a good lad, Sweets, but this book he's writing, he's using it as the vehicle to get what he actually wants. Which is....[Booth looks at Wyatt]...a family.

Angela: Yes, yes you did. Um, but, um, the puddy that they used to fill in the face has sort of...melted. And, um, his nose is sort of, going to the side. [Mrs. Reilly cringes] Um, and his hair....is like Hitler.
Booth: Hitler.
Mrs. Reilly: [horrified] Hitler??
Angela: Listen, I really think it would be best if you let Mr. Tung fix him up before you see your son.
