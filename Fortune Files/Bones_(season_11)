Temperance "Bones" Brennan:&nbsp; [upon Seeley Booth taking a bite of her edible, gelatinous brain mould prop]&nbsp; Whoa, Booth!&nbsp; That wasn't a model; that was an actual brain I brought back from the lab.
Seeley Booth:&nbsp; Ugh, oh, God!
Temperance "Bones" Brennan:&nbsp; Gotcha!

Cam: [to NSA Agent Gill] And I'm afraid I don't work for you, I don't answer to you and until I see a court order saying I have to share information with you, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the building.

Booth: I'm not saying what Greystream Solutions does is right.
Brennan: But you're saying you dislike what Vivian did as much as they do.
Booth: Okay, and you're okay with what she did?
Brennan: I take the long view, the historical view. {{w|George Washington}}, in his day, was considered a traitor.
Booth: Oh, okay, well, now you're just trying to piss me off.
Brennan: Washington was a British subject who led an army against his own country.
Booth: It's not the same thing.
Brennan: How do we know? Sitting here today, how do we know if history will look at Vivian Prince as a patriot agitating for change or a traitor to her country? 
Booth: You know what, I'm sorry, Bones, but it doesn't take me 200 years for me to know that she was wrong. I'll catch her killer, but Vivian Prince was wrong.
<hr width=50%>
Cooper Blackthorne: There's very little that I can disclose that isn't above your clearance level. I'm here purely as a courtesy.
Brennan: Did you kill Vivian Prince? 
Booth: Bones, not exactly where I was gonna start.
Brennan: Well, if he's being difficult, we might as well cut to the chase.
Blackthorn: I like her style.
<hr width=50%>
Booth: I'll bring in Gill.
Hodgins: Uh, no, you can't.
Brennan: But we have to. He is very likely the last person to see Vivian alive.
Hodgins: If you bring Gill in, whoever killed Vivian is gonna know who "The American" is. You might as well pull the trigger yourself.
Booth: Well, maybe he should've thought of that before he committed treason.
Hodgins: Booth, there's got to be some way you can meet with this guy and talk to him in secret.
Booth: This guy put dozens of agents' lives in jeopardy. What, you want me to give him some kind of special treatment? 
Hodgins: He was trying to do the right thing.
Booth: Stop right there, okay? You never served. You don't get the right to defend this guy.
Hodgins: I'm just saying, Booth––
Booth: [interrupts] What you're saying is that it's okay for this guy to put other people in danger. You know what? It's not.

Angela: Oh, this is where the victim was before he died-- the Frontier Games. It's a weekend-long, role-playing, Old-West-style shooting competition.
:[...]
Angela: The next Frontier Games will be taking place this weekend. 
Cam: [sighs] Why do I have a feeling Booth already knows this? 
[Aubrey, Brennan and Booth are at the diner]
Aubrey: Undercover? Seriously? 
Booth: Well, the likely suspects are the participants. [hands Brennan some notes] Look.
Brennan: 85% of the competitors are repeat guests from all over the Eastern Seaboard.
Booth: Which is exactly why we have to go undercover. Because if we don't, we're gonna have to coordinate branches in seven different states, we're never gonna find the suspects––
Aubrey: Oh. You just want to dress up and play cowboy for the weekend.
Booth: Yeah, well, if I can do that and solve a crime, why, who wouldn't want to do that?
<hr width=50%>
Brennan: [after Booth intentionally messes up in the shooting competition] You're not doing very well, Booth. You didn't even make the board.
Booth: I'm not even trying.
<hr width=50%>
Brennan: I feel so foolish.
Booth: Why do you feel so foolish? 
Brennan: All of this, all of it! Ah. It's so irrational. I mean, how could I think that flirting with another man and besting you at a game of skill would have a positive effect on our relationship? 
Booth: Wait a second. First of all, if you think I'm worried about you running off with some doughy guy who's dressed in some U.S. Marshal's outfit that's way too tight, you're wrong. Secondly, besting me? I'm a trained sniper. I could win this competition blindfolded. The only reason I'm not doing it is 'cause I don't want to raise any eyebrows.

Booth: [shows his FBI credentials] There's a new sheriff in town, and his name is Special Agent Seeley Booth. And you're under arrest for the murder of Stanley Belridge.
Brennan: And I'm not Wanda. I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan. I'm also the mother of his children. [sees Glen and Franny's crestfallen look] That's right. Sorry.

Hodgins: [to Angela] I love us. So much. The three of us. We're like a tight little cocoon of love.

Booth: [gets off the phone] Yeah, that was Aubrey. There was a body found in Columbia Heights.
Brennan: So does this mean you'll be missing date night? 
Booth: Nah, Aubrey can take care of himself. Besides, I don't want to miss that whore sauce.
Brennan: Will you please stop referring to the puttanesca as "whore sauce". 
Booth: I'm sorry but does puttanesca not mean "in the style of the whore" in Italian? 
Brennan: Yeah, it does, and every time I make it, I regret having told you that.
Booth: Whore sauce.

Aubrey: So what do my beautiful-brained colleagues have for me tonight? 
Hodgins: Might want to watch the way you talk about Cam's brain there, Aubrey. Wouldn't want her man overhearing. 
Aubrey: Oh, the, uh, photojournalist? 
Cam: His name is Sebastian, and he's not my man.
Hodgins: [laughs] That's not what the smile on your face is saying.
Cam: The smile on my face is saying "Mind your own business.

Brennan: Are you sure you want to take this case, Booth? 
Booth: What are you talking about? 
Brennan: Aubrey may die.
Booth: Don't talk like that! Aubrey is not gonna die.
Brennan: He may, and if he does, I'm worried you'll react the same way you did when Sweets died.
Booth: Okay, look, when Sweets died, I blamed myself. You understand? The weight of the guilt is what drove me to gamble again.

Fisher Well, I'm afraid it's classified. But what I can tell you is that I travel extensively, and I'm always surrounded by young, nubile women.

Hodgins [greets Fisher happily] What are you doing here? 
Fisher Consulting for the Secret Service, leading in Dr. Brennan's absence. Typical man of action stuff. [looks at Hodgins] Wow! I see Angela wasn't joking about you being paralyzed.
Hodgins Uh, no. No, not-not a joke. Just a lot of pain, misery and self-loathing.
Fisher Feelings in which I'm very well-versed.
Hodgins I do remember.

Booth: This inquiry is related to an ongoing murder investigation. Just need to know why you've been spending so much time here at the range recently.
Travis: I don't know. I guess since I've been back, this is the only place that makes sense.
Booth: According to these files, you're pretty outspoken towards the president.
Travis: Look, all I said was he didn't serve. And unless you serve, you shouldn't be allowed to send others off to die.
Booth: Travis, I know how you feel. All right? I served. I was a Ranger. I saw things that that still stay with me. But it gets better.

[Hodgins and Dr. Oliver Wells are playing a video game in Hodgins' lab.]
Hodgins: Hey, don't do no, no, Oliver, stop! Come on, man, you can't do that. You can't do multiple boosters, it's not fair.
Wells: Your face isn't fair.
Hodgins: [stares at Wells in disbelief] That doesn't even make sense.
Wells: Your face doesn't make sense.
:[...]
Wells: Your face is so big that it creates non-Euclidian triangles of over 180 degrees around it.
Hodgins: Is that right? Really? 
Wells: Yeah.
Hodgins: Really? Okay, well, your face is so expansive that the lensing effect is such that a light passing within one {{w|astronomical unit}} has a {{w|radius of curvature}} of 6e to the ninth meter.

Booth: Well, there's {{w|cross-checking}}. I mean, being slammed into the boards, not to mention all the fighting that there is in hockey.
Brennan: [impressed] This is very useful, Booth. You're practically an intern on the case.
Booth: All right, stop. Not an intern, don't call me an intern, don't even think about calling me a squint, all right? I just happen to know a little bit about hockey.
