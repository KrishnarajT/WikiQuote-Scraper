Romano:  All you're doing is convincing me I need a lawyer.  
Sweets:  You prepared the rat.  You didn't just dice it up and toss it into the pan.  You treated it like a fine fillet.  You really hated Richard Bartlett.

Romano:  Ok, now your just being insulting.  
Sweets:  Because I'm accusing you of murder?  
Romano:  'Cause you're insulting my cooking!  He loved that burger.  You can check my emails.  All Bartlett does is rave about that burger.  Why would I kill him?  Now, I never get the satisfaction of seeing that bastard's face, when he finds out that he had Rat, every Tuesday night.

Booth Hey there, Christine. It's me, your father. Dad, Dada, Daddy. If you're watching this right now, I'm dead. Um, if I was a good father to you, you're sad right now. If we had some sort of, like, falling out, let's just forget about it and move on. It's just-it's not worth it. You know, personally, I'm doing everything I can to get into Heaven right now, but your mother believes, well, she thinks that, I tell you what. Why don't you ask her. It's complicated. These are the last words that I'm going to-to speak in this world, so here it goes. I like God. I really like God, and I think that he likes me. you know I, um, I love Canadian beer, and hockey. They kinda go hand in hand. I really love loud music and really sad music. I love this country. And I'm proud to have served in the military. I'm the luckiest man in the world because I got to spend time with your mother. And with you. And that's true, you know? It's true, whether I died today or 50 years from now. It's true. Okay? I love you. And I want you to-to love life. Dive into life. Be courageous. Question things and-and be happy. And don't forget to laugh. Oh, and one last favor.
