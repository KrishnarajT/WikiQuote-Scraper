Ron: OK everyone, SHUT UP AND LOOK AT ME!  Welcome to Visions of Nature.  This room has several paintings in it.  Some are big, some are small. People did them and they are here now.  I believe that after this is over they'll be hung in government buildings.  Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me.  I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they can just go outside and stand in it.  Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further.  End of speech.
