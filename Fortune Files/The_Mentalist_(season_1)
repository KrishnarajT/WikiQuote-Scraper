You can fly away and leave all your burdens and worries and fears behind you. [pauses] Imagine that. What a nice feeling it is. Next time you see me, [taps Raquel gently on the knee] when I say hello you'll remember that good feeling and you will want to tell me the truth.

[Brooke Harper is trying to open a locker when Jane and Cho come up from behind her]
Jane: Hello, gorgeous.
Brooke Harper: Beat it, creep.
Jane: I'd call you by your real name, but I don't know what it is.
Brooke Harper: [Turns around and sees Jane] Hello, Mr. Jane.
Jane: Hi.
Brooke Harper: I'm impressed.
Jane: Oh, for finding you? Wasn't that difficult.
Brooke Harper: Would you have a cigar?
Jane: Thank you, no. I hear they're not so good for your health.
Brooke Harper: Well, who wants to live forever?
Jane: It'd be horrible, wouldn't it? Immortality. Imagine the boredom.

Jane: Yes, this is also the key to a locker that holds ten million dollars.
Brooke Harper: Really? I thought it was for cigars. I love a good cigar.
Jane: Nope. Ten million dollars.
Brooke Harper: But that's just silly. Why would Jim keep ten million dollars in a locker?
Jane: [To Cho] She's good.
Cho: Yeah, she is.

Brooke Harper: How did you find me?
Jane: Well, let's make a deal. I'll tell you how we found you if you tell us who you are.
Brooke Harper: Okay. [With a British accent] My name is Angela Dalibar and I'm from Birmingham, England by way of Hong Kong. How did you find me?
Jane: I planted a GPS tracking device on you. Outstanding technology. No bigger than a stick of gum.
Cho: Tell us more about yourself Angela. How long have you been a professional con woman?
Brooke Harper: All my life, I suppose. [She drops the British accent] And I confess, my name's not really Angela.
Jane: And I didn't plant a GPS tracking device on you.

Rick Bregman: Six months of living in that chair. Six months and no one ever questioned me about it. Why did you?
Jane: Whenever I meet someone in a wheelchair I check the bottoms of their shoes. The bottoms of your shoes were scuffed. I've been checking shoes for years. This is the first time it's ever paid off. First time. That's gratifying, man. Very, very gratifying.

Jane: That urge you have to get one over on people, the need to be smarter than the next guy? It'll keep biting you on the ass.

Jane: Make much money, playing the keyboards?
Keith Gulbrand: No, but I'm not in it for the money. You know, music is a...it's a spiritual thing.

Jane: When was the last time you saw a doctor's handwriting you could read?
Lisbon: So she's precise. Is that what you're implying?
Jane: Yes, and the possibility that Dr. Brooke Harper is not a doctor.
Lisbon: Because she has penmanship skills?
Jane: And she doesn't have that cold, creepy, doctor-y vibe they all have.

Rigsby: Be fair. Not all the Doctors are cold and creepy.
Jane: First day in Medical School they get a stack of books and a dead human being. That, I'm afraid, would change you. Brooke Harper was warm and emotional.
Lisbon: You like her so she can't be a Doctor.
Jane: Pretty much.

Rigsby: I hate the woods.
Cho: Would you rather be playing desk jockey with Van Pelt right now?
Rigsby: Who sends their kids to a place like this? It's not cheap either.
Cho: A little deprivation and discipline is good for the soul.
Rigsby: Yeah, but this is like a juvie prison camp.
Cho: No. This is like spring break in Cancun compared to juvie.
Rigsby: Wait, you were in juvenile hall? Seriously?
Cho: Yeah, didn't you read my file?
Rigsby: No. Wait, did you read mine?
Cho: Of course.

Lisbon: I hope you got something useful for all the trouble you caused.
Jane: Yes, I did. The story of the mad axeman Zachariah, who lives in these here woods.
Lisbon: Ah, Z.
Jane: Yes, Z. I would have gotten more, but you came back too quickly.
Lisbon: Reality check. I'm your supervising agent. I'm not your decoy.

Chief Brody: Do you have any actual facts?
Jane: Well, it's an actual fact that you dislike Mr. MacLean here because he's a tree-hugging, liberal wacko who's probably running some kind of a cult. And he dislikes you because you're a small-minded, provincial hayseed. Not that you are necessarily. That's just what he thinks.

Jane: Do you always follow your husband's lead? Do you never struggle against his desire to control?
Mr. Plaskett: Excuse me?
Jane: Just because you drink too much doesn't mean you don't have a say. I should think he's at least half the reason you drink in the first place. Yeah? A good man, but cold, pious.

[Jane is interrogating a suspect]
Jane: Please understand something. I have a very personal interest in this case. I'll do whatever it takes. I will have you framed for murder. I will torture you, I will kill you myself if I have to.
[Lisbon and Minelli are listening on the other side of the glass]
Minelli: Geez, Lisbon. Come on, this is on tape. Control your man there.
Lisbon: Cut him some slack. Look, he's just playing the guy. He doesn't mean it.
Minelli: Doesn't he? You know what Red John does to him. He can't think straight. He would do all that he said and more if you let him.

Jane: If we catch Red John, he's not walking anywhere. He's mine.
Lisbon: Don't talk like that. I can't let you anywhere near this case if you start talking crazy like that.
Jane: Crazy? You're crazy if you think you're gonna stop me. Red John is mine. You try to stand in my way and you will regret it.
Lisbon: Are you threatening me?
Jane: No, I'm just saying that if you stand in my way you--
Lisbon: [interrupting] I've had it with your egotistical crap. This isn't about justice or the law. This is about you and your wounded pride. I'm done with it. Judge Tahoe, 288 Wispering lane? (goes to walk away) If he JayWalks...shoot him!
