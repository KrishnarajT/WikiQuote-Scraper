Meredith: [opening voice over] This is how my mother wanted to be remembered. My memory of her is a little bit different. I'm sure everyone remembers their own version of her. Versions I wouldn't even recognize. It's all that's really left of someone when they're gone. But that's the tricky thing. Nobody's memory is perfect or complete. We jumble things up. We lose track of time. We are in one place and another. And it all feels like one long, inescapable moment. It's just like my mother used to say: The carousel never stops turning.

Richard: I lied to you before... About what happened that day at the carousel. I remember what she said. I remember what I said. I remember everything. It was a Thursday afternoon. We had made a pact. She would leave Thatcher, and I would leave Adele. Your mother had just received her first Harper Avery nomination. She was so excited. And I was... jealous. Not like healthy competition. A hateful, hopeless jealousy, too far ahead to catch up to. Her success illuminated everything I hadn't yet accomplished. The night before, as I worked up the nerve to tell Adele, I thought of your mother. I thought of what she could do at such a young age. I thought of what she would do. And I thought: "I will spend my life feeling like this, my entire life." So I ruined it.

Ellis: I was the only woman on my surgical residency program, they called me "girl" and "Ms. Grey". Along with the one black male resident I was clearly excluded. They didn't want me to be part of a group of males. So I did the only audacious thing that you can do with an audacious technique. I got myself published on the major american medical magazine, that caused an apbold, a resident was published. But the most audacious thing came when they saw how I named my technique "The Grey's method". You should have listened to the boy's reaction.
The first time I won the Harper Avery, I dedicated it to the men who'd been so supportive. No, I wished. But I'm just kidding. The first time I won the Harper Avery, I thought, "screw all those boys." I stood there, holding that trophy, and I thought to all that I sacrificed, what I had to just overcome. And I dedicated that award to all the women surgeons who would come after me.

Maggie: I cannot sleep with someone lying next to me. Literally cannot. My one serious guy? Dean. Dean just loved to spoon and snuggle, and I would just lie there, staring up silently, counting the seconds until he would fall asleep and I could sneak off to sleep on the sofa. And then I'd sneak back into bed before he woke up in the morning. Yeah, people think that's a cute story. It's not a cute story. That sofa was hard as a rock. I was exhausted. Dean is a really sweet guy. He's tall and kind. Civil rights lawyer. He's funny. So when he proposed, I explained to him about the sleeping.

Penny: I'm so sorry. I know that that's useless to you right now. But I am. He saved all those people. And it was my job... to save him. And I failed. And now... He's gonna die... Because I was not a good enough doctor... to keep him alive.
Meredith: Yeah, you're right. You did fail. You weren't good enough. But do you know what tomorrow is? It's Friday. There's gonna be more patients who come in who need you to save them... someone's mother, someone's kid, someone's husband. They need you to save them because they can't save themselves. So learn from this, better yourself, and you will be better for next time.
Penny: What if I'm not?
Meredith: You will be.
Penny: How can you know that?
Meredith: Because he was your one. Every patient you treat, you're going to see my husband's face and remember that he was the one that died on your watch. He will haunt you. The hard ones always do. And it only takes that one. But that one will make you work harder, and they make you better. Or they make you quit, and you don't get to waste what would have been the rest of my husband's life being a quitter. So get back inside because you're not saving any lives out here.
Penny: I really am so...
Meredith: Yeah, I know. I know.

Meredith: [opening voice over] Time stops when you’re in the O.R. You step up to the table, you evaluate the patient, you pick up a scalpel, and then you go into a bubble. It’s just you and your surgery and nothing else matters; not time, not pain, not exhaustion, nothing. It happens in real life too. When something big happens, something tragic, you freeze, you retreat into your happy bubble for what seems like a second, until you look up. And suddenly, you realise it's a whole new world.

Meredith: I'm sorry about leaving the patient there. I didn't want to leave him there, either. And I am sorry for not talking to you about the house.
Amelia: You don't talk to me about a lot of things.
Meredith: And you're mad at me for going away, and I am sorry about that.
Amelia: That's not...
Meredith: I mean, I couldn't breathe. I couldn't exist. You know, I looked around at that house, and my kids, our kids... I couldn't breathe.
Amelia: You didn't call me.
Meredith: I didn't call anyone. I needed time.
Amelia: I am a neurosurgeon. I could have saved him. And you didn't call me.
Meredith: Amelia...
Amelia: Who contacted you first? The police? The paramedics? How far away was the hospital? How long were you sitting there waiting for them to declare him brain-dead? How many hours later was it before I was even informed? How many chances did you have when you could have called me? Why didn't you call me?
Meredith: There wasn't anything you could've done. He was too far gone.
Amelia: You don't know that. You don't know.
Meredith: Yes, I do.
Amelia: What if I could've helped him? What if I had a chance? I pull off miracles for a living. I have proven that I can reverse the impossible. I should have been there. If I had seen him or treated him...
Meredith: It was too late. By the time they... It was too late.
Amelia: How could you do it? How could you unplug him without letting me know? I didn't get to see him. I didn't get to tell him goodbye. I thought you would've at least given me the courtesy and the respect when my own brother was dying. I didn't get to tell him goodbye because of you.

Meredith: [ending voice over] How do you step back into the world? It’s scary. Time stood still and now it’s speeding by. You’re looking for a lifeboat, something to give you hope. But are you really ready to leave your happy little bubble and step back out into the big, blinding, bloody, terrible world? Are you ready to achieve the impossible?

Meredith: [opening voice over] I remember once in school someone saying I came from a broken home. That’s what they used to call it when your parents got divorced, even though getting divorced was the least broken they ever did. When I heard that as a kid, I wondered if broken homes were where broken people lived. It was silly, I mean I was just a little kid. But, to this day I still wonder.

Meredith: (talking to Richard and Catherine) What is the matter with you two? My husband is dead. Yeah, I'm gonna play that card. You (Richard). You walked away from Ellis, never got to be with her, and now she's dead. Adele is dead. And you (Catherine)... I don't know who's dead for you. But the both of you are very, very much alive and breathing and driving each other crazy. And you yell and argue and fight, and you both should be thrilled to be able to do those things. I would give anything to be able to do those things. And none of those things are reason enough to not be with the person that you love, especially when there just isn't enough. There will never be enough time. And you both know that. So whatever it is that that's coming between you two, will you just please figure it out? Figure it out.

Maggie: My parents are getting a divorce. My mom called and told me today. She's been having an affair with the man that services their cars... For 11 years. He's been servicing their cars and my mom. And my dad found out about it years ago, and he was enraged, and he stuck with it for me, because I was... I was still in town. I was always around. You know, so they held it together for the kid. Classic. Except the kid's a grown woman. They wanted to preserve my... happy, idyllic... pathetic, crap-filled lie of a childhood!
Meredith: Why didn't you tell me?
Maggie: I... Your husband died, and I am crying like a 7-year-old over mommy and daddy. I... I didn't grow up like you. I... I've never lost anyone. I never even had a cat die. I still have all my grandparents. There's no darkness in my life. Just, I've never had it. So I-I'm not gonna come talk to you about it.
Meredith: Well, you should always come talk to me... Because whatever it is, chances are, I've seen worse, and I am qualified to tell you how you'll survive. You should always come and talk to me.

Derek: Hey, it's me. I'm on the ferry. I just wanted to say that, um... God, I wish you could see this. Weather's classic Seattle. Oh, the water is so blue. It may be the most perfect ferryboat ride I've ever had in my life. We're gonna do this a lot more when I get home, by the way... you, me, and the family. We're just gonna take a day and... ride the ferryboat... all day if we want. I love you, Meredith. I know I just left, and I'm not even at the airport yet, but I just wanted to say... I love you. I love our family. And we're gonna keep doing this. I'll see you when I get home. I love you.

Meredith: Derek would have loved this. He came from this big, noisy family. I want this to be my last memory of this house. That's what he wanted, to fill it with noise and people. Okay. We have to dance it out.
Amelia: What?
Maggie: What does that mean?
Meredith: Let's go.
(They go back into the house and dance.)
