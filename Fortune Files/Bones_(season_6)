Booth: No, what I did was mostly administrative.
Brennan: Because you seem really very heavily armed in this photograph.
Booth: How about you? Any headhunters or cannibals?

Angela: Did you think about Booth at all when you were away?
Brennan: Yes, I did. A few times I actually dreamed about him.
Angela: Oh, well there you go! Dreams are very meaningful.
Brennan: I dreamed about the work we do. I dreamed about catching murderers and getting justice for people who were killed. What does that mean?

Hannah: Really?
Brennan: Yes! He's been looking. He says that's what a phone is supposed to be: indestructible and heavy enough to knock someone out.
Hannah: [laughs] Yeah, that sounds like Seeley.
Brennan: His grandfather kept his rotary phone until it fell apart. Booth loved the feel of the bakelite, the tick-tick-tick of the dial as it turned. He says the mechanics make it human.
Hannah: And lucky for me, he has a partner who knows him so well.
Brennan: Booth and I have become very close, by necessity. Congratulations again. I'm happy for you both.

Booth: Really. Can we just focus on the case?
Angela: No twinges at all?
Booth: It's over, okay? Hannah and I are done. I've moved on.
Angela: Okay. So what are you gonna do?
Booth: Nothing! Valentine's Day is not a holiday. It's just made up by these greeting card companies and florists.

Booth: So do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Brennan: Is the order at all relevant?
Booth: You know, people they like to get the bad news first so the conversation ends in happiness.
Brennan: All right, then. What's the bad news?
Booth: Well, the court refuses to compel a DNA sample from Ericson based on what we have so far.
Brennan: [mobile phone rings] Do you mind? It's not work related.
Booth: Go right ahead.
Brennan: Brennan.
Booth: I'll be right here.

Brennan: A secret service agent from my gym.
Booth: Of course.

Booth: Look, I'm not her mother!
Brennan: [to person on the phone] Okay, I don't have a mother. Could I phone you back to tell you no? Thanks! [to Booth] All right, what's the good news so that we may end this conversation on a happy note.
Booth: Ericson has a son in prison for insider trading.
Brennan: Why is that good news? It seems the entire family is degenerate.
Booth: Bones, it's good news because it means the son's DNA is on file with CODIS.
Brennan: Right. So Cam can compare it to the sample from under the fingernails and see if there's sufficient alleles in common to match the dad.
Booth: See. Always start with the bad news first then go with the happy. Are you happy now?

Angela Why is that so strange? You are a shrink.
Hodgins [to Sweets] He wants to name our baby. We're not supposed to have any input. Now that is weird! Right?
Sweets Um, well you know it's... it's complicated, of course, as all family issues are. [pauses] No, I'd rather not shoot from the hip on this one. Perhaps some research and reflection....

Booth: We're gonna get this guy and he's not gonna keep doing this.
Brennan: Your words are quite ironic.
Booth: What do you mean?
Brennan: I imagine Broadsky would say the same thing as he stalks his prey.
Booth: Except I'm the good guy, he isn't.
Brennan: But you both led a life in which you were paid to take lives.
Booth: Why are you doing this?
Brennan: I just like to understand. I admire your certainty but since good and bad are such subjective concepts, how could you ever be sure you're doing the right thing?
Booth: Ok, well, it's not subjective to me. I mean there's good and there's evil. Life is all about taking sides. Broadsky? Well, he joined the wrong team.

Booth [sighs] I don't get it. Broadsky was a good man. I don't understand what happened to him. I mean, what gives him the right to make these kind of calls?
:[...]
Sweets Being the cause of someone's death, no matter what the circumstances, leaves a man with a great burden. And people deal with that burden in different ways, you know? Some celebrate it. They relish the power as a way of justifying what they've done. Others like Broadsky, they justify another way. They feel that it's their destiny to mete out justice. They convince themselves that they have the moral high ground to make these calls. It's the only way they can live with what they've done.
Booth What about me?
Sweets From my perspective, you're a healthy man. You can accept what you've done and the pain and sadness and regret that comes with it. You know, not everybody has the strength to deal with that reality. It's a testament to you that you've built this life with family and friends who love and respect you. Booth, that can't be easy.

Brennan: You are similar in many ways.
Booth: [sarcastically] Great! Thanks, Bones.
Brennan: But not in the most important way. How can I put this in a way that you will understand?
Booth: Why don't you try and say it in teeny tiny words?
Brennan: Okay. Broadsky is bad. You are good. That's as simply as I can put it.
Booth: [laughs] You don't believe in absolutes like good or bad, all right? You think it's where people stand.
Brennan: From where I stand, you are good and Broadsky's bad.
Booth: Thanks for standing there, Bones.
Brennan: I'm standing right beside you, Booth, like always. Like I always will. I'm being metaphorical, of course, because we are currently sitting.
Booth: Thank goodness, because I thought I'd shrunk.

Brennan: Yes...His mitral valve is completely calcified. How did you know?
Walter: He had pyramids on the ceiling of his bedroom.
Brennan: Wh..Pyramids indicate heart disease?
Walter: Of all the things humans created, pyramids stood the test of time best. Dying people invest all sorts of meaning in it. So, uh, did you find any signs of torture?
Brennan: Yes, I did. Three fingers were dislocated shortly before death. It's possible, given his heart condition, the victim died with his secret intact.
