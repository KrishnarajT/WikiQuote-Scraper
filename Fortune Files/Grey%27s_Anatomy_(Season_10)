Webber: [voice over] When you become an intern, there is a ceremony where you get your white coat. Like magic, you are a doctor. My parents came to my white coat ceremony, I can still picture them, so happy...so proud. They say your life flashes before your eyes right before you die, you see things in your life, the important moments --the moments that tested you, the moments that made you who you are. I don't know about my life flashes before me, I was thinking about my white coat... it's the moment my life started, same fitting should be on me when it ends

Meredith: You know what I was thinking before you guys came in here? [sighs] I was thinking that I wish my mother were here to see my kids. I was wondering if she'd make a good grandmother. But you know what that is? It's delusional thinking. Because my mother would make a horrible grandmother, because she was a horrible mother. So... I'm delusional and hormonal. And I can't trust my delusional thoughts. I have to rely on the labs. So we need to run the lactate again, and if it's above 6, we're going to do the surgery. And if it's not, we're not.
