Beckett: No. you definitely weren’t dreaming.

Bracken: What do you want, Ms. Beckett? 
Beckett: The truth.
Bracken: Never expect that from a politician. Besides, if you really had information, wouldn't you already know the truth? 
Beckett: Roy Montgomery, McCallister, John Raglan, my mother. Everyone that you've ever had killed, I want you to admit to it.
Bracken: Your mother’s death was a tragedy, and I am deeply sorry for your loss. But I can’t give you what you want. When I was fourteen, I got to be friends with this boy in the neighborhood, Lamar Dokes. Sweet kid. I used to help him with his homework after school. Well, one day, he doesn’t come to school. so I went by his apartment and the door was open. I walked in and…I found Lamar lying on his mattress… dead; his little sister the same way. His mother was in the bedroom. She had hanged herself. Now she left a note. She’d list her job. She was being evicted. And I thought, how could a woman be so desperate, so without hope, that she could crush up pills, put them in hot chocolate, and give them to her kids? And that was the moment, the moment I knew I wanted to help make people’s lives better. And I have. I strengthened the safety net to protect kids like Lamar. I created jobs in those neighborhoods. I’ve done great things. Just as you’ve done great things.
Beckett: Who do you think you're talking to? How can you justify yourself to me? My mother was stabbed in an alley because of you. She bled to death alone in a pile of garbage! So save me your campaign speeches about the great things.
Bracken: You sound a bit delusional, you know? But then again, who are you? You're a disgraced cop, obsessed with her mother's murder. And who am I? I'm a decent man looking out for the little guy. That's who the public sees. And every time they elect me, I'm humbled. I strive harder to live up to that ideal. I want to be that man. And I won't let you or anyone else get in my way.
Beckett: I don't think you're in a position to threaten, senator.
Bracken: See, here's what you don't understand. It's not who has the gun, it's who has the power. Do you really think that's you? 
Beckett: I have the file. Smith had another copy. 08672241. That's the number of the bank account where you deposited the money orders. So you're right. It is about who holds the power. Now I could release that file and destroy you, but what would that mean for my life expectancy? So here's how it is. The deal that you had with Smith, that's our deal now. And if anything happens to me or anyone that I care about, that file goes public. Am I clear? That's a yes-or-no question.
Bracken: Yes.
Beckett: And one more thing. Whoever it is you think I am, whatever it is you think you know about me, you have no idea what I’m capable of or how far I will go. I am done being afraid. It’s your turn now. [swings pistol at the Senator's face] That's gonna leave a nasty scar. Every time you see it, think of me.
<hr width=50%>
Gates Your resignation has been accepted. The matter’s settled.
Beckett Sir, I have the top case-closure rate in the precinct. And now that the man that shot me is dead, that particular case will no longer be an issue.
Gates Really? Because it seems to be the gift that keeps on giving. I’m told we put a Michael Smith under guard at the hospital. What was his role in this?
Beckett I don’t know.
Gates I don’t believe you. You’re covering for someone and I know who it is. But I don’t intend to dig up the past and tarnish Roy Montgomery’s reputation. The fact is, I admire your loyalty. I hope you feel that for me someday.

Castle: [Beckett is talking to Stevens, with no luck] I'd like a minute with him. [Beckett leaves the room]
Douglas Stevens: [Castle closes and locks the door to the room] I just said I don't wanna talk, so you can't question me. I have rights. I'm not going to say anything without a lawyer.
Castle: I'm not a cop
Douglas Stevens: Then who are you?
Castle: You remember the girl with the red hair? I'm her father. Please know, I will do whatever it takes to get her back. The police outside are my friends... my daughters' friends too. So it's just you and me.
Douglas Stevens: If you touch me I'll press charges... 
Castle: I don't care. Where are they?
Douglas Stevens: I'm just a driver. I, I don't know anything...
Castle: You know Henson ditched the van for the black Yukon. So where did he go? Where did he take the girls? [Stevens refuses to answer] I won't ask you again, where did he take the girls? [when Stevens still refuses to answer, Castle closes his eyes for a few seconds, then slowly opens them]

Liam: What?
Ryan: Remember when we tussled back in the hall? Yeah, I picked your pocket. And then when you weren't looking, I dialed my partner and left the line open.
Liam: No way.

Beckett: Esposito spoke to the girl. We know she's alive.
Castle: How do you know it's the same girl? It's possible he someone to be his alibi.
Beckett: Or it's possible something else entirely is going on here. Look... I know that you're lonely and that you miss me. I miss you, too. But you don't have to keep making up things to have me come back here.

Esposito I may have an explanation for those facial wounds. Turns out our victim worked at a retirement home called Haven House.

Beckett And what’s your connection to Dale Tanner?
Stack Tanner was under scrutiny by the FBI, DHS and the Pentagon, not to mention the NYPD Counter-Terrorism Unit. Somebody objective needed to look into his death, so they picked me.
Beckett When did you realize that he was killed by a drone and not a car bomb?
Stack Once our people examined the wreckage.

Stack I didn’t know where this was headed. The AG needs deniability.

Castle Yeah, but this time I mean it.  The Force is stronger with this one.
<hr width=50%>
Beckett I don’t understand what a car driving through the desert has to do with Dale Tanner.
Warburg [holding the photo up] Intelligence reports said there were three high-ranking Afghan militants in this car. It was the right make and model, traveling at a high rate of speed. So the drone pilot was given the green light to strike. But then, he saw those red dots on the trunk, and he had a feeling. So he aborted the mission. There were no militants in that car. The red dots were roses; because the young couple driving down that desert road had just gotten married. That’s when I knew I could no longer be a part of the drone program.
Castle But I don’t understand why. The pilot didn’t fire.
Warburg Because the next generation of drones won’t have pilots. The new AI software will give drones decision-making capability. They’ll assess the data and take lethal action all on their own.
Castle Really will be rise of the machines.
Warburg Those new drones would turn that car to ash without hesitation. That’s why, when lives are at stake, we need a man who sees roses. We need the human factor.
