Michael: Ladies and gentlemen, I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
Dwight: WHERE!!?
Phyllis: WHEN!!?
Michael: It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best they could and she is going to be okay.
Stanley: WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!!!?
Pam: Thank goodness you were there
Michael: [shaking his head nervously] Yeah...
Andy: Did you see who did it?
Dwight: No need. We can just check the security tapes
Michael: It's kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
Jim: Who was driving?
Pam: oh Michael...
Jim: One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway...... I wonder who he ran over then
Michael: I ran down Meredith in my car.
Ryan: Did you do this on purpose?
Michael: No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital. She's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in&mdash;
Ryan: Did this happen on company property?
Michael: Yes. It was on company property with company property, so... double jeopardy. We're fine.
Ryan: I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
Michael: Oh right, I'm sorry.  What is, "We're fine?"
Michael: Do I need to be liked?  Absolutely not.  I like to be liked.  I enjoy being liked.  I have to be liked. But it's not like this compulsive need to be liked, like my need to be praised.
Angela: [after Dwight feeds her cat] Any problems?
Dwight: Well, you left the TV on.  Also, your cat is dead.
Michael: It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious but I'm a little stitious.  
Michael: Kelly, you're a Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.
Kelly: That's Buddhists.
Michael: Are you sure?
Kelly: No.
Michael: Guess what. I have flaws. What are they?. Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me!.. No, don't sue me. That's the opposite of the point that I am trying to make.

Michael: Yeah, Ryan snapped at me.  But there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on which said, "Dude, we're friends.  I'm doing this for appearances.  I am the big boss now.  And I have to seem like an ogre.  But you know me and you trust me.  And we like each other.  And we'll always be friends.  And I would never take you for granted in a million years.  And I miss you, man.  And I love you."  His words.
Creed: [to Ryan] Hey, brah. I've been meaning to ask you. Can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right?  Later, skater.
Michael: Computers are about trying to murder you in a lake.
Dwight: [to Angela] I just wanna be friends.  Plus a little extra.  Also, I love you.

Dwight: I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows. Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them.
Michael: It was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face, to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive. Who I had cared about. But you know, I'm not going to cry about it. I did that on the way home.
Angela: I can't do this. I can't do it.
Michael: Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say it if I didn't 100% believe it. Who else could do this?
Angela: Okay. Okay.
Michael: No seriously, is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time.
Michael: Good news.
Stanley: We get to go home?
Michael: Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
[Everyone voices their approval]
Kevin: Wait. Alfredo's Pizza Caf√©? Or Pizza by Alfredo?
Michael: Same thing.
[Everyone grumbles in disagreement]
Michael: You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
Kevin: Oscar, talk to him.
Oscar: Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste. Which one did you order from?
Michael: Pizza by Alfredo.
[Everyone groans]
Michael: Okay, okay, what's better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all-you-can-eat of pretty good pizza?
Everyone: Medium amount of good pizza.

Kevin: Oh no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
Manager: Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start.
Ryan:  And now from my old hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
Michael: Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that asshole.
Ryan: Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear.

Oscar: 'Cause we're looking up "jail time".
Jim: Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
Pam: Yeah: "Enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your deskmate Dwight."
Jim: That's when I knew. You?
Pam: You came up to my desk and you said, "This might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat is expired."
Jim: That was the moment that you knew you liked me.
Pam: Yep.
Jim: Wow. Can we make it a different moment?
Pam: Nope.

Michael: You're a presentation tool!
Michael: Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money-wise.

Michael: I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!
Oscar: I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
Michael: I didn't say it. I declared it.
Dwight: As of this morning, we are completely wireless here on Schrute Farms. As soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll have that power back on.
Dwight: My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
Jim: Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton? 
Dwight: [sobs]
Jim: Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam. Yeah, I mean, she was with Roy... and I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it, Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. And then weird stuff, like, food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. And it is something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. And that includes you.

Jan: Come on! It's a cute story. Michael ran through the sliding glass door because he thought he heard the ice cream truck.
Michael: Stop! Stop it! I mean... I like ice cream, okay? Sue me! Oh no, don't! I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue! She loves lawsuits. You know, honey, that door was extremely clean, and it looked invisible. 
Jan: You are so right. You are SO right! Because before I lived here the glass was always covered with smudges and I moved in and I cleaned it and I guess that makes me the devil!

You have no idea the physical toll that three vasectomies have on a person! And I bought this condo to fill with children! 
Jan: I am so sorry that I don't wanna bring kids into this screwed up world. 
Michael: I am sorry too.
Jan: But look if you wanna have kids, then fine! You win! Let's have a f**king kid!
