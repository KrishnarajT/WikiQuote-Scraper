Meredith: [opening voice-over] There's a reason the punchline to so many doctor jokes starts with "I've got good news, and bad news." Often, the bad news is so bad, when something good comes along, we tend to go a little overboard.

Meredith: [opening voice-over] You know that story where a child gets trapped under a car and their parent finds the superhuman strength to lift the car and save the child's life? I always wondered if that was real. If someone I cared about was hurt or trapped, would my instincts kick in? Would I know what to do? Would I lift the car? Jump in front of the bullet? Would I be able to beat somebody senseless? I like to think I would.

Veronica: I already have an expiration date. Aren't we past a little worried about some risks?
Miranda: If we did this, if we could remove the tumor and keep your pregnancy intact, by the time you deliver, the cancer will have still grown unchecked for six months. It'd be too far along by then for us to treat it. I mean, you would literally be sacrificing your own life for your child's.

Veronica: Jeremy pushing our kid in the swing, touching his toes when they're in the sky. And the baby thinks it's so funny. I can see them growing older together, getting to the good stuff. Jeremy showing him "Star Wars" for the first time. "Episode IV," 'cause you can't start anywhere else. High school, college, his first apartment. Jeremy's there, and he's the best dad. I picture that, and all this crap is for something. A happy ending. I die, but there's something good still. There's something good to see. I picture it your way, and everything goes black. There's nothing. Only death. If this is the only chance that my baby has to survive, I am not looking for a guarantee. I'm looking for a chance.

Amelia: I had a baby. A baby boy. I had a son. Had? When I was living in L.A. He was born with anencephaly but... without a brain. So he lived for, um... 43 minutes. And I held him. I got to hold him. And then it was time. And he was... He donated all of his organs. And then I let him go. And it almost killed me.
Alex: I didn't know.
Amelia: No, you wouldn't. I never told my family. Not Derek, not Meredith. No one. I haven't told Owen all of it. And I don't think I can. He wants a family so bad. How do I tell him that... He won't look at me the same way.
Alex: Are you kidding?
Amelia: He's gonna hate me.
Alex: I don't think so. It's Hunt.
Amelia: I took a pregnancy test last night. I thought I might... And, uh, as I sat there waiting for the result, I just watched him get more and more excited. He wanted it so badly. And the longer I sat there, the more I felt like I was dying. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't move. And when that stick was negative, Owen's heart broke. And I was so relieved. I could breathe again. See. Now look me in the eye and tell me that he won't hate me.

Meredith: [closing voice-over] When someone you love is in physical danger, finding the strength you need to save them is easy. But sometimes the threat isn't physical. Sometimes, it goes deeper, in which case, no instincts can save you. No superhuman strength, no adrenaline rush. You can't power your way out of the crashing car. All you can do is sit and wait and wish things were different.

Meredith: Have you always done that with your mother?
Webber: I didn't used to. Back then, I was trained to depersonalize the patient. Tissue was tissue, faces were covered, and blood was a mess on the floor. We were to stay focused, and our hands were inside just mannequins.
Meredith: So, what changed?
Webber: One afternoon, I was in the OR, and we lost a patient on the table, and I went along to inform the family, you know, tell them the horrible news, and I was numb. I watched them sob and hold each other and it didn't affect me, at all. That patient died from the same thing my mother died from, and I was a robot. After that, I started changing the rules, and it made me a better surgeon.
Meredith: You've saved her now, about 1,000 times.

Sometimes it’s easy. Sometimes you play games in your head. You make up someone. Someone good. Whatever you need. To keep you going.

You were talking with Pierce, and she said something that made you laugh, and I couldn't move. And then I had to wait for you to write your name on the board because I just needed to know who you were. So, I don't have a good reason for you to like me. I didn't even try to like you. I didn't want to. And I certainly don't want to have to think about you all the time, trying to come in early, see your name on the board, come up with that one thing that's gonna make you smile so your eyes do that thing they do. Anyway, so that's why I joke so much and to keep from having to say anything like this. So, I don't have a good reason. I'm sorry. I wish I did.
