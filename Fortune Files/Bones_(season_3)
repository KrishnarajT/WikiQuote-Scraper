Zack My regimen is easily completed in my apartment. Treadmill for 30 minutes, 100 sit-ups, push-ups and leg-lifts, and 20 minutes of free weights. I'm deceptively strong.
Cam I'm deceived.

Brennan Does Tommy share your affection?
Pam Why do you ask it like that? Because I don't look like a scarecrow? [to Booth] Like her?
Brennan Hey. Wha- what are you coming after me for? [to Booth] Do- do I look like a scarecrow?

Sweets Mocking will not change my opinion. I've been mocked many, many times before. That came out wrong.

Brennan Until I was thirteen, I wanted to be the next {{w|Cyndi Lauper}}.
Booth I'd say you're kidding, but I... I don't think you know how to kid.
Brennan The other girls and I referred to her as "rad." [laughs] My mother said that I sang just as well.
Booth As well as Cyndi Lauper?
Brennan Yes.
Sweets Mothers do that. It's healthy.
Brennan No, this wasn't just flattery. My mother told me that I sang "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" better than she did. 
Sweets It was an expression of affection, Dr. Brennan, not an objective evaluation of your abilities.
Brennan Well, I think you're wrong.
Booth Okay then, go ahead, belt it out.
Brennan No!
Sweets Yeah, come on. Give us a few bars.
Booth Come on...
Brennan I can't just bust into song. I have to have music and an appropriate atmosphere of frivolity.
Booth Diva, forensic genius, best-selling author, better than Cyndi Lauper...

Cam That's enough, we're going. Now.
Brennan I have remains to identify. He could have a family.
Angela He's 500 years old. They've probably adjusted by now.

Brennan I knew I shouldn't have gone to that funeral. It was a complete waste of time, just like I said.
Booth Wait a second. You thought that my funeral was a waste of time?
Cam I thought it was a lovely service, Booth.
Booth Thank you! You know, I expected to see more people though...
Hodgins I always imagined a lot of ex-girlfriends crying.
Booth Yeah. Me, too.
Angela You guys are pathetic.
Brennan [to Booth] Just know I won't be attending your next funeral.

Brennan You should have told me that you weren't dead.
Booth I already explained this to you. The Bureau has to vet everyone when there is a security issue. I was just following protocol!
Brennan Protocol?
Booth Yes!
Brennan We've been partners for three years, Booth, and you've broken protocol before! Sometimes putting my life in danger, which makes sense because you clearly don't have any real concern for me!
Booth [stands] I took a bullet for you!
Brennan Once! That only goes so far!  (pause) Would you like a towel?

Booth Bones broke into my house last night...
Brennan [interrupting] There was a key!
Booth All angry because nobody told her that I was dead. And I was just following protocol!
Sweets Broke into your house?
Brennan There was a key.
Booth And barged into my bathroom.
Sweets [laughing] Wha... What were you doing?
Brennan He was drinking beer and reading a comic book.
Booth I was taking a bath!
Sweets You read comics and drink beer naked?
Booth Wait a second. Bones bursts into my bathroom, all right, and I'm weird for being naked?
