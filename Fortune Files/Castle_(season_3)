[Castle explaining to Beckett why he had the gun at the murder scene]
Castle Maybe you missed the part where I said she was shot dead. When I heard the noises coming from the next room, I thought whoever killed her was coming back. So I picked up the gun to defend myself. It seemed like a very good idea at the time. That’s when you, Esposito and Annie Oakley [gestures to the viewing room] come bursting through the door.
Montgomery Annie Oakley?
Ryan I kind of almost shot Castle. What? He had a gun.

Castle Do you know what these bodies are? A sign.
Beckett A sign?
Castle A sign. A sign from the universe telling us we need to solve this case together. You don’t wanna let the universe down, do you?
Beckett You’re not gonna go away no matter what I do, are you?
Castle I respect the universe.
Beckett Okay, fine. I will let you join me on this one case as long as you promise to do what I say, when I say it, and not to do any investigating on your own.
Castle I promise. You won’t regret this.
Beckett I already do.

Castle: I know what you would do if you won the lottery. 
Beckett: By all means, please come in. So, what is your big insight into a financial decision I will never have to make?
Castle: You would use the money to honor your mother's legacy. On the way over here I called the dean of your mom's old school and we talked about starting a scholarship in Johanna Beckett's name. One that will provide a full ride for students planning on dedicating their careers to those in the legal system without a voice, the kind of people your mom championed. And, with your blessing, I would like to host a fundraiser to fund it.
Beckett: You just can't stay out of my personal life, can you? [Castle looks at her with fearful eyes; she smiles] Thank you, it's really sweet.

Castle I don’t care about statistics. I am telling you Damian is not capable of murder.
Beckett You know, I could say that about maybe three people that I've met in my entire life. What is it about this guy that warrants this unshakeable faith that you have in him?
Castle When I was fourteen, my mom sent me to Edgewick Academy. I was homesick and I didn’t have any friends, so I wrote about it. One day I submitted a story to the literary magazine. Damian Westlake was the editor.
Beckett And he published it.
Castle More than that. He called me down to his office. He sat me down and he said, "Ricky, you have a great talent." No one had ever said anything like that to me before. Damian, he encouraged me, he critiqued me, he always made me dig a little deeper. Without Damian Westlake, I'm a lawyer, I'm a grifter, I'm a rodeo clown, but I'm not a writer. Without him, I'm not me.

[After telling Damian that they also found the man who killed his father years ago]
Damian Wow, this is… It is pretty overwhelming. I got a plane to catch, so maybe we should just talk about this later.
Castle Michael told the cops you got in touch with him. Asked him if he wanted to make a lot of money for one night’s work. You gave him your Rolex and your car as a down payment. When your inheritance came through, he got a half million dollars and a one-way ticket to Los Angeles. He still has your Rolex…and a map that you drew of your father’s house, with a path leading straight to his bedroom.
Damian Rick, he’s lying.
Castle [voice hardening] Tell me you didn’t do it.
Damian Ricky, I…
Castle Tell me I haven’t been believing in you all this time for nothing.
[doorbell rings]
Castle That’s them. Detective Salazar and some New York detectives. They’re here to take you in. [rising up from his seat] I told them you’d be a gentleman.
<hr width=50%>
Beckett "Show me a hero and I’ll write you a tragedy." F. Scott Fitzgerald said that.
Castle Then it must have been Ernest Hemingway who said, "Man, I sure could use a drink right about now."
Beckett Lead the way. I’m buying.

Castle But with one foot out the door, it's hard to know where you stand.
Beckett And even if I did, I mean, what does it mean? He's out there, he's saving people. How do you even compete with that? 
Castle You can't. No. No one can.
Beckett That's one of the things that attracted me to him the most. That passion. That drive. Why is it that the thing that attracts you to a person always ends up being that thing that just drives you crazy? I just wish that it I wish that I had someone who would be there for me, and I could be there for him, and we could just dive into it together.

[Fallon and Beckett interrogating Radford in order to find the bomb]
Fallon Do you see yourself as a great hero, doing this for a mighty cause? You think that’s how people are going to see you? Because, I’ll tell you right now, brother, if you let this happen, you’re going to go down in history as America’s greatest mass murderer. Is that what you want?
Radford When this bomb goes off, do you think they’re going to be looking at me? People will see this as an act of terrorism, so they will be looking for a terrorist. Not a patriot. Not one of their own.
Fallon Is that what you think you are? A patriot? There’s a word for people like you, it’s not “patriot.” It’s “traitor”.
Radford The powers that be have no use for a traitor. So when they find their terrorist, and they will find their terrorist, what do you think will happen to me? [Fallon shrugs] Well, let me tell you, because I know them, I know how they think. I will become a footnote in one of your files, buried so far back no one will ever find it, because anything more would be an inconvenience to their self-serving, rabble-rousing narrative.
<hr width=50%>
[After the failed interrogation]
Fallon We needed him to break, I saw an opening, I took it.
Beckett You violated his rights.
Fallon I can think of probably a dozen federal lawyers that would disagree with that. He was never in any real danger. I removed the bullets from my clip. The gun wasn’t even loaded.
Beckett Well, mine was.
Fallon Yeah, well, I was pretty sure you weren’t going to shoot me.
Beckett You know, next time I wouldn’t be so sure

:<div align="justify">Rick Castle Why would anyone want to kill a writer?
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett Oh, so many reasons.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle Or maybe Sarah discovered that Greek billionaire Mikos had invented a machine that could cause blizzards that would plunge the entire world into an ice age.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett Really? You're gonna go with a evil weather machine?
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle It already happened. On General Hospital. Look, bear in mind, we're entering into a world of epic drama with larger than life characters, each one teaming with twisted secrets and personal intrigue. It stands to reason that the motive for this murder will be worthy of a soap opera.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett Castle, even in a world of epic drama, the motives are usually quite ordinary.
<hr width=50%>
:<div align="justify">Martha Rodgers [after Castle asks if she knew Lance Hastings] He was my love interest thirty years ago. On screen. And off. After my character married his character, Joseph Fox, she was kidnapped, buried alive, trapped in a cave with bears, kidnapped again, and held hostage in the sewers of Paris.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett How long were you on the show?
:<div align="justify">Martha Rodgers Three weeks. 
<hr width=50%>
:<div align="justify">Javier Esposito I know she's a murder suspect, but you got to admit she is smoking hot.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle Agreed. So hot, in fact, that it led to a torrid affair with Sarah's director husband. Sarah found out about it, decided to kill off Mandy's character. Doesn't get any soapier than that.
:<div align="justify">Javier Esposito Well, obviously, you haven't seen Chiquitas.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle As in bananas?
:<div align="justify">Javier Esposito No. As in the telenovela. I used to watch it growing up with my grandmother. Bro, there was this one episode where Gabriella discovered that her husband was sleeping with her evil twin sister, Teresita, only to later find out that she had multiple personality disorder.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle Wait, does that even qualify as cheating?

:<div align="justify">Johnny Dimes Husband? No. She hired me to investigate Gloria Chambers.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle The mom. I knew it. Was she involved in organ harvesting?
:<div align="justify">Johnny Dimes That didn't really come up. But I can tell you this, Gloria Chambers isn't her real birth mom. She's a fake.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle Oh. The mom isn't really the mom? Does it get any soapier than that?
<hr width=50%>
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett Okay, so Gloria is in the clear. Uniforms showed her photo at the OTB, and a bartender there remembers seeing her at 11:15.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle You know, I can see why she fell for Gloria’s con. Sarah was motherless, childless. She was taking young writers under her wing. She was looking for family.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett Wow, Castle. That's a refreshingly down-to-earth theory.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle Just trying to keep you on your toes.
<hr width=50%>
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett Maybe Sarah was having an affair.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle Well, that makes perfect sense. Sarah was separated from her husband, Vince. And after long, grueling days at work, she'd go home to a cold, empty apartment. Feeling lonely, betrayed, she seeks comfort in the arms of this mystery man.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett And she decides that she wants her husband back, so she writes his mistress, Mandy Bronson, off the show in order to save their marriage.
:<div align="justify">Rick CastleAnd her next step would be to get rid of the other man.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett So maybe the other man didn’t go off quietly into the night.
:<div align="justify">Kevin RyanDo you two practice this when we're not around?
<hr width=50%>
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett Okay, found the deal memo Sarah signed in order to get Lance out for his movie.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle He wasn't lying. My mother's never going to let me forget this.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett Oh, come on, Castle. She'll probably think it was sweet that you were concerned about her.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle This is Martha Rogers we are talking about. I intruded on her "moment." No, I will pay dearly.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett When Lance came here, Sarah told him that someone wasn't who she thought they were. Who do you think that was?
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle How about the woman who makes my mother look like a saint?
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett Yeah, but Sarah already cut Gloria out of her life. Maybe ... Maybe it was her cheating husband.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle Except Lance met with Sarah after Mandy Bronson. By the time Mandy showed up, Sarah'd already decided what she wanted to do with her marriage.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett Yeah, but even if Sarah decided that she was gonna get back together with Vince, it doesn't mean that she didn't have doubts.
:<div align="justify">Rick Castle No. No, you're right. Except he has an alibi. Everyone has an alibi.
:<div align="justify">Kate Beckett Yeah, well, somebody out there doesn’t, and we are gonna find them.

Montgomery I haven't accomplished everything I wanted to on the job, but I've done enough. It's time for me to move on. 
Evelyn Best gift ever. More Roy.
[The Montgomerys kiss.]
[After Montgomery tell the team he plans on retiring next year]
Montgomery Mm-hmm. Look, I taught you guys everything I know about doing this job, alright? You're going to be fine without me And for crying out loud, lose the long faces. Smile please? That’s an order.
[All laugh]
Montgomery Hey, you kids take care, alright? You guys behave now.
Esposito You have a good time.
Beckett Congratulations you guys. Goodnight.
Montgomery Thank you.
Evelyn Bye.
Castle Happy anniversary.
Montgomery Goodnight.
Ryan Goodnight, Captain. [Turns To Castle] What the hell did you say to him?
Castle Nothing. No, I-- I just told him to listen to what his wife wanted.
Esposito Damn, Castle.
Castle How can you think-- I didn't-- There's no way--
Beckett Castle, let me let you in on a little secret. Captain Montgomery retires all the time, just give it a week or two. He's like the Brett Favre of the NYPD. Trust me. He's not going anywhere. 
Castle Not going anywhere.

Castle Ashley. What are you doing here?
Ashley Hey, Mr. Castle.
Alexis  Hey, Dad, guess what?
Castle [Smiling] What?
Alexis I’m going to Stanford.
Castle [Blinks in confusion] What?
Alexis I’m applying for early admission. And since I’ve been taking extra classes each semester since my freshman year, I have enough credits to graduate in the fall.
Castle [Sitting down, stunned] …What?
Alexis Yeah. This way, Ash and I will be together in January, in college!
Castle [In greater confusion] What?
Ashley That was actually her idea, sir.
Castle [In disbelief] What?
