Chloe: That's not what I've been saying, Lucifer.
Lucifer: I know. It's what I'm saying. You deserve someone better. Because you, Detective, are selfless to a nauseating degree. You always put your daughter first, even though the ungrateful urchin does nothing to contribute to the rent. [Chloe chuckles] So, you deserve someone worthy of that grace. Someone who knows every crime scene breaks your heart, even though you'd never admit it. Someone who actually appreciates your impossibly boring middle name, "Jane". And more importantly, Detective, you deserve someone as good as you. Because, well, you're special and I'm... I'm not worth it.

Narrator/God: Choice is a funny thing. Give someone different options, different circumstances, will they themselves end up different? Sure, they might end up with a different job, find inspiration from different people. But will they still be the same person at their core? Some might continue down a darker path, never knowing there was a different way. The potential buried deep down, but still there. Some make immoral choices instead of moral ones. But they will still have the same conscience. The question is, will they ever make the choice to listen to it? And sometimes, it isn't the right moment in someone's life to make a certain choice. And no matter how badly you want to nudge them in the right direction,... you know they need to find it on their own. And some people find love in the strangest of situations, and are, somehow, happier for it.... And some, no matter how you shake things up, end up making the same choices, are drawn to the same people, the same passions. So all seems to have ended well. Does that mean I never should've manipulated things to begin with? I have a better question: Wouldn't you do the same in my shoes? After all, a parent just wants what's best for their child.

Chloe: [mildly] Right, right.

Lucifer: Why would you ever trust Michael? He's a liar!
{Maze attacks Lucifer, but he evades her.] 
Maze: He's only ever been honest with me.  You... You hid my mother from me.
Lucifer: How did you--?
{Maze again goes on the offensive, but Lucifer parries her assault.] 
Lucifer: I'm sorry, Maze, but I gave Lilith my word.
Maze: Which is apparently more important to you than I am!

Lucifer: [softly] Dad.

[Dad/God has brought together Lucifer, Michael, Linda and Amenadiel for a family dinner]
Michael: I know what you're trying to do, and I'm not going to let you ruin this, Samael.
Lucifer: Very well... Mike-ael.
Michael: It's "Michael".
Lucifer: Is it? I mean, we're twins after all. Fairly certain Dad wanted them to rhyme. Dad?
Dad/God: I did like the sound of that. "Samael", "Mike-ael". [chuckles] But you boys had other ideas.

[Lucifer has just called out Dad/God for torturing everybody all in the name of his "mysterious ways"]
Lucifer: Ooh, for example: Dad! Are you ever going to tell us why Hell suddenly doesn't need a warden any more?
[There is a long pause]
Dad/God: I have a good reason.
Lucifer: Oh! It's a good reason! Well, that explains it. As always, super clear, thanks Pops.
Michael: What are you even complaining about, Lucifer? You got your own kingdom as a reward for bad behavior.
Lucifer: [bitterly] Is that how you see it? Being forced to torture souls for hundreds of thousands of years was an 'attaboy'? Sure, I was King of Hell, but I was still in Hell. If that's not a poisoned chalice, I don't know what is! [Lucifer gets out of his seat] You have no idea what that was like, how easy you had it! 
Michael: "Easy"? [scoffs] I spent my entire life in the worst kind of Hell there is.
Amenadiel: Luci, Michael, come on!
Lucifer: What could possibly be worse?
Michael: Sharing a face with you! Guess what? When your twin is the Lightbringer, turns out you have no choice but to live in the shadows!
Lucifer: We were dealt the same hand, the same face, the same bloody shoulders, except you had a chip on yours so big, you managed to self-actualise it! Oh, no, no, no! There's nothing wrong with him, don't be fooled! You have no one to blame but yourself for who you are!
Amenadiel: Luci!
Michael: Oh, I blame you plenty!
Amenadiel: Michael!
Lucifer: Of course you do, you petty little sh-

Chloe: [referring to the victim] Hey, Ella. You wanna catch Lucifer up?
Ella: Oh. Sure. [dramatically serious] So, it was the fourth quarter. It had just hit the two-minute warning. Cathedral High's down by three. But, they've got possession. Cheerleaders--
Chloe: Do you wanna [coughs] just skip to the --
Ella: --flag on the play. Right. Well, poor Steve Rockwell here dropped dead at the fifty-yard line. 
Chloe: Everyone thought he died of a heart attack, but Ella figured out he was murdered.
Ella: Yeah. Someone [holds up an evidence bag] wet his whistle with poison.
Lucifer: That blows.

Reese: Do you really think it's possible to change?
Lucifer: Of course. I mean, look at me. For millennia, I was down here, stuck in my own Hell loop of sorts, thinking I deserved to be in charge of people's punishment. And then even when I left, I found myself in a cycle of selfishness and violence, [smiles] debauchery, sex... Yeah, I mean, clearly it wasn't all bad, but the point is, with the right guidance and the right help, I was able to change, to grow. To... find true meaning in life.
Reese: I wish I could just... take it all back. Everything that I did on Earth.
Lucifer: I hear you. I felt that way, too. I wished I could do everything differently, but then, I wouldn't be the devil I am right now, sitting across from you, right here, would I? [chuckles]
Reese: I dunno. Maybe I'm just a lost cause.
Lucifer: Nonsense, Reese. And certainly not on my watch. Because if the Devil can be redeemed, then anyone can.
