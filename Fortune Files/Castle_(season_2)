Beckett: [written on a therapist's body] "Psycho the rapist your out of time"?
Lanie: Looks like a patient lost their patience.
Castle: Also his command of grammar. "Your" should be You-apostrophe-R-E as in "you are." That's not even a tough one, not like when to use "who" or "whom."

Beckett: [confused] "You take our murder, we'll take yours".
Castle: Could it be that easy? You take mine, I'll take yours.
Esposito: What are you getting at, Castle?
Castle: Strangers on a Train.
Ryan: The Hitchcock movie?
Castle: I'm partial to the novel by Patricia Highsmith, but yes. We have two strong suspects, but with airtight alibis, right?
Esposito: Right.
Castle: We know they're connected. What if the connection is the killers?
Beckett: Jason and Eric committed each other's murders.
Castle: And made sure they had an airtight alibi for the murder they knew they'd be suspected of. It's not our victims that are connected, it's our murderers. Crisscross!

Esposito: Lanie ran the substance on our vics against the Hudson River water. It's a match. 
Ryan: Marx gets on the boat uptown, Cosway joins him at Chelsea Piers, and they ride to Pier 11 together.
Castle: So one day, maybe they start talking. Maybe about the Yankee bullpen, maybe about the attractive secretary leaning up against the railing. Oh, and Jason starts grumbling about his wife. Eric maybe mentions how he covets Frank's apartment.
Esposito: Yeah, well, there's an open upper deck. I figure that's where they were doing their plottin'.
Beckett: And how the water from the Hudson got on both of them. 
Castle: It gets transferred from Eric Marx's jacket and gloves to Ashley Cosway when they struggle.
Esposito: Then to Frank Anderson when Jason Cosway swipes his watch and wallet. 
Ryan: Done deal.
Beckett: Except it's all circumstantial. The DA will never buy it without hard evidence or a confession.
Esposito: Oh, we're gonna get a confession.
[Beckett and Castle scoff as they look at each other and then back at Ryan and Esposito]
Castle: Not if we get one first.
Ryan: So, bet's back on?
Beckett: [getting in his face] You bet your britches the bet is back on.

Beckett: [smiling] Four of Mom’s favorite words.
Jim: Look, she was a devout believer in the truth. And if she were here right now, she’d tell you the truth can never hurt you. You know, this may be your mother’s way of reaching out to you, Katie. And reminding you that the truth is still your weapon to wield. Not theirs.
