Arastoo [to Cam] I was persecuted in Iran. I lost my home, my cousin was killed, so I have an idea of what it means to want vengeance. And I held onto that anger. I became that anger until that's all I was, until I decided to let it go and realize that sometimes the world is an unjust place that we have to accept. If I didn't decide to forgive I wouldn't have the life I have now. I want to be able to have you.
