Meredith (voice over): Dying changes everything. There’s the emotional fallout, sure. But there’s also the practical stuff. Who’s going to do your job? Who’s going to take care of your family? The only good thing for you is you don’t have to worry about it. People you never knew will be living in your house, working your job. The world just keeps on going… without you.<br />

Then you have to try to remember where its matching card was. Sometimes you have no idea, and other times you chose exactly what you need to see. The cards seem completely out of order and random but you keep turning them over and the more cards you see.. you get the sense of how everything fits together.

I have a lot of memories of people, people I've lost forever, but I have a lot of other memories too. This is the place where I fell in love. The place where I found my family. This is where I learned to be a doctor, where I learned to take responsibility for someone else's life. And it's the place I met you so I figure this place has given me as much as it has taken from me. I've lived here as much as I've survived here, it just depends on how I look at it.

It's hard for me to change things. And you grew up there, too. So before you go trying to change everything about yourself, you got yourself this far.

[Shane is freaking out in the OR]
Derek: I went out to the {{w|Hoh River}} to fish winter steelhead. For hours, I tried to cast like I'd practiced. But if you over try, it'll never happen. And then just once, the rod loaded perfectly. The line formed a tight loop and the fly just danced out over the river about seventy feet. It had a life of its own. See, the key was to relax, feel the rhythm and let the rod do the work. Just one perfect cast.
Shane: Why'd you tell me that? 
Derek: Did it calm you down? 
Shane: Yeah.
Derek: Right now I am about to remove a hematoma from {{w|Broca's area}} and if I am not careful, she'll never speak again. There is a lot to be afraid of. Patients will be afraid. Parents will be afraid. And the only way to get through it is for you to stay calm.

Meredith: [voice over] At first, idleness can seem like a welcome distraction. The troublemaking and the fun. Everyone needs some idle time to focus on something other than work, even if it means focusing on something that's a little bit scary. Stepping back from work is the only way to change perspective. And it's only after we had everything in perspective that we remember where our hands truly belong.

Meredith: [voice over] Let's say you're standing in an OR, staring at an aneurysm that's embedded deep into a patient's frontal lobe. There are three things you'll need to remove it. You'll need confidence, you'll need an eleven blade and some really good instincts.

Meredith: [voice over] There are some feelings that refuse to go away, they're little distractions whispering in your ear. Some things just get under your skin. Try as you might, you can't ignore your instincts. It's like they say, always follow your intuitions.

Meredith: [voice over] Patients say it all the time, "Tell me straight up, I just want to know what's going on. Tell me, I can handle it." We don't dodge your questions because we're mean. We do it because when you say you want the truth, you have no idea what you are talking about.

Meredith: [voice over] They say the truth will set you free. What the hell do they know? The truth is horrible, frightening. The truth is more than you can bear. We're supposed to be straight with you, so be careful what you ask for when you walk into a hospital because when you find out what's really going on, you may never recover.

Bailey: [voice over] Infections are like sleeping monsters. You can't see them, you can't feel them. But you must do everything in your power to contain them. Because when the monsters wake up, they're out of control.

Meredith: [voice over] There's no such thing as magic, as far as we know. And while as surgeons, we study the secrets behind the human body's intricate network of cells, tissues and organs. When things go wrong, horribly, horribly wrong, there are only so many tricks we have up our sleeves to put a body back together. But there is a kind of power, more of a spell really, and when we get it right, it can be pretty damn magical.

[Cristina is standing outside the lab where Miranda has holed up herself in.]
Cristina: [about her coma patient] No, I know what you're thinking. EEG. I've already done one, and he's not having seizures. So why hasn't he woken up? Yeah. I've asked every doctor in the hospital for their opinion, and no one has any ideas. Oh, my god. You're right. Go global. Bailey, you are a genius.
Callie: Oh, Cristina. How'd it go with Bailey?
Cristina: So great.
Callie: Did you get her to talk?
Cristina: No.

Derek: [to Miranda] You've seen me mad. I hang out in the woods and I drink myself into a stupor. But the thing I've learned from hiding out is, it doesn't work.

Derek: [to the rambunctious younger brother of a patient] Hey, listen to me. Your sister needs rest today. You want to know why? 'Cause we opened up her head and we put magic inside. So I'd be nice to her if I were you, 'cause she has special powers. You understand? [the boy nods] That's what I'm talking about.
Heather: He put a vampire in her head. I'd watch out, kid.

Meredith: [voice over] As surgeons we are no stranger to the breaks and tears in the human body, in fact we sacrifice the better part of our twenties learning every possible way to make it a whole again. But there are some wounds a surgeon can't repair. Not on their own. It takes a kind of power we just don't have. There's no such thing as magic, not in the traditional 'abracadabra, genie in a bottle' kind of way. But there is magic in knowing that while not everything can be repaired, most everything can be survived.

Meredith: [voice over] They hit you out of nowhere. When bad things come, they come suddenly, without warning. We rarely get to see the catastrophe coming, no matter how well we try to prepare for it.

Owen: When you and Derek adopted Zola, how did you know? I mean, how did you really know that that was something you were gonna do?
Meredith: Why? Are you thinking–– 
Owen: Yeah, forget it. Just forget it.
[Later]
Meredith: You asked me about Zola today. We just knew. You know, Derek knew first, of course, because he's Derek, and it took me a little longer because I was scared. One day, I just picked her up, and I just knew. I don't know how else to explain it. I looked at her, and she was my daughter. I just knew.

Derek: Oh, damn it. The CSF is leaking. This is worse than I thought. The crack has torn the dura.
Heather: It's pretty grody.
Derek: "Grody" is not a thing we say. List the possible complications.
Heather: Um, death, that's pretty solid. Strokes, re-clots, being a potato, goofiness, loopiness, simpletonism.
Derek: [annoyed] Brooks.
Heather: Difficulty with speech, memory, and vision. Why are you making me talk so much today?
Derek: Because you're weird, and it bugs me. But you also have a natural talent for this. And the weirdness is there because you're covering up a real lack of confidence in your natural talent. So now it is my job to make you feel confident and less weird. Ok? 
Heather: Whatever twists your knickers.

Dr. Jason Myers: Oh, you wanna be my friend now? 
Alex: Me? Nah. I got enough friends. Cristina Yang, she's my friend. She owns the hospital. Derek Shepherd, owns the hospital. Meredith Grey, her name's on the friggin' door. And these are my friends. And they don't like a guy who hits his girlfriend. Neither do I.
Jason: She attacked me. What was I supposed to do? 
Alex: You're supposed to take it. A girl hits you, you take it, or you walk away.

Meredith: [voice over] We do our very best, but sometimes it's just not good enough. We buckle our seatbelts, we wear a helmet, we stick to the lighted paths, we try to be safe. We try so hard to protect ourselves, but it doesn't make a damn bit of difference. Cause when the bad things come, they come out of nowhere. The bad things come suddenly, with no warning. But we forget that sometimes that's how the good things come too.

Meredith: [voice over] I had this bad ass professor in med school. She seemed invincible. Then, one day, she needed her {{w|gallbladder}} out and the surgery killed her. Her platelets stopped clotting, she bled out on the table. Everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong. Surgeons have a name for it. We call it a perfect storm. Funny, never thought it would happen to me.

Arizona: [briefing the interns assigned to the NICU] This is important. The makers of tiny humans get easily spooked. It is our job tonight to keep the tiny human makers happy or they will mutiny and we are outnumbered. We remain calm. We remain confident. Because everything is just fine. Understood?

Cristina: I felt such joy today in that dark OR. I could hear the blood moving. I knew exactly what the heart muscle was thinking. And I realized after I feel that way all the time. I'm made for the OR. Even the boring procedures, I can feel pure joy, content. You feel that with just me? 
Owen: What kind of a question is that? 
Cristina: Derek watches Zola put applesauce in her ear and he's enchanted. You felt that way with Ethan.

Arizona: Ahh, you weren't on the plane Callie! You weren't in the woods, and you did not hear Meredith crying for Lexie, or Mark moaning in pain, or hearing me scream in pain, you weren't there, and you keep acting like you were, but you weren't, and it wasn't your experience.
Callie: [crying] I lost Mark; you almost died.
Arizona: "I lost Mark; you almost died." You weren't on the fricking plane! You wanted the street cred, the badge of honor, the warrior wounds, Great! Stick out your leg and I'll grab a bone saw and let's even the score! [crying] Ohh...
Callie: [crying] It always comes back to the leg..
Arizona: [crying] I trusted you more than anything... more than anyone in my life. And you decided to cut off..
Callie: To save your life!
Arizona: You didn't lose anything! I did, I did! 
Callie: Apparently I lost you...
