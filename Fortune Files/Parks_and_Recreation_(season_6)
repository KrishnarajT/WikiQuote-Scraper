Ron: What brings you to the festering putrid stink hole on the armpit of freedom?
Allison: ...
Leslie: That's what he calls City Hall. 
Allison: Leslie was just telling me about your summer internship and I was thinking about taking it. 
Ron: [laughing] Oh no no no no! No! I respect your father too much to let his daughter work for free for the government. Why don't you get a paying job for the summer?
Leslie: Why don't you shut your mustache!? 
Allison & Ron: ...
Leslie: Sorry.

Ron: I attended Prom with Susan Hoffler. I picked her up in my truck, we slow danced to a Merle Haggard song, and then I left early to go to my shift at the quarry. I was twelve years old. Never went again. Felt like I had outgrown it.

Andy: Look around. The bloom of youth. Like flowers on the sunset of an eagle's poetry. 
April: Andy. I hate teenagers!
Andy: If you give this a chance, you're gonna love it. I promise. It's like the movie Expendables 2. First time, hated it. Second time, hated it. Third time, it was okay. Then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth time I watched it, I realized something. It's just it's not good. It's not a good movie. Now that I've convinced you, why don't we go dance?

Leslie: So have you ever pulled a ceremonial chord before? There's a little trick to it. You wanna hold it not too tight, sort of like a firm handshake, and then move towards the ground in a rope-pulling motion. 
Allison: So just...pull the rope.
Leslie: That's right!

Donna: I didn't go to my Prom. I was dating an older man at the time. Like I'm gonna dance with a bunch of kids while he's coaching Duke to the final four. 
April: I just wanna go home but I feel bad because Andy's having such a good time. 
[view of Andy having a dance off and having a great time]
April: How can I love someone when I hate everything he loves?
Donna: That's not true. He loves a lot of dumb stuff but he loves you the most. If something's bothering you, just tell him. It's always better to be direct. 
[guy walks up to Donna]
Guy: Hey girl. Are you ready to go?
Donna: I feel like I told you to wait in the car. 
Guy: ...Yeah. [walks off]

Leslie: It's flu season again and I cannot get sick! I have too much work to do. Unfortunately Pawnee is like a breeding ground for disease...due to our poor hygiene habits and raccoon density.

Craig: Good evening. May I assist you with a wine tonight?
Tom: Yeah I'm having fish so maybe a full-bodied red.
Craig: You know sir you might want to consider something white to go with your fish.
Donna: No, red! And bring some ice cubes. I like ice cubes in my red wine. 
April: I'll have a glass of your most expensive red wine mixed with a glass of your cheapest white wine served in a dog bowl. Silly straws all around please. 
Craig: ...I'll be right back with my recommendations. [walks out] 
Tom: Seems to be keeping it together
Craig: [from the other room] WHAT KIND OF MONSTER ORDERS RED WITH FISH!? I KNOW THEY'RE MESSING WITH ME AND IT'S JUST A TEST BUT HAVE SOME DECENCY!

Craig: For you sir, a light crisp Pinot with just a hint of lemon to bring out the flavors of your fish. [to Donna] I brought you a bold Cabernet which should still taste okay when watered down. [to April] And for you madam would you consider this Rose, it's halfway between red and white. 
Tom: Thanks very much!
Craig: Enjoy. [walks out]
Tom: I think I might have found my new sommelier.
Craig: [from the other room] THAT WAS SO EMBARRASSING!

Dr. Saperstein: Well actually one in 8,000. Triplets occur a lot more frequently then you imagine, especially at your age. Your body is prone to releasing multiple eggs. It's what we doctors like to call - and I don't mean to be insensitive - a "Going Out of Business Sale."
