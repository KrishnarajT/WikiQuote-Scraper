Booth: What is with the breath coming through the back right now? It smells like death warmed over almost like a toxic blast of camel butt.
Aubrey: [looks offended] Wow. This is a black kale chia smoothie.
Booth: Why? Why are you drinking that? Did you lose a bet or something? 
Brennan: Do you have an infected lesion? 
Booth: What? Why would you even ask that? 
Brennan: Well, black kale is high in vitamin K and antioxidants, both of which promote healing.
Aubrey: Jessica just thought maybe it'd be a good idea if I went on a junk food cleanse.
Booth: Go back to the donuts because that just smells like monkey ass.

Booth: I'm a sniper, you hear me, and snipers, they do not fire blanks.

Brennan: Booth, I found something.
Booth: She found something.
Francis: Oh, my Is this where he died? 
Booth: No, this is where he went to heaven.
Brennan: My husband is euphemistically referring to sex. By the sheer quantity–– 
Booth: [interrupts] You're gonna need a new cleaning service. So who was Mr. Felbeck seeing? 
Brennan: By seeing, he means in-intercourse.

Brennan: Angela, is this one of the computers from the retirement home? 
Angela: Yeah. And you won't believe what I'm finding.
Brennan: I assume you're referring to pornographic material? 
Angela: Enough to make a teenage boy blush. You'd think at a certain age enough would be enough.
Brennan: Not for the male of the species. They are biologically programmed to keep wanting sexual gratification. Which is why I told Booth he needs to get a {{w|vasectomy}}.

Aubrey: Unlike Booth, I am an equal opportunity accuser. See, I don't care about sex, age...just motive and opportunity.

[Dr. Gordon Wyatt visits Booth's office with a plate of {{w|petit four}}s and notices Aubrey looking at it.]
Dr. Wyatt: Agent Aubrey, if you were to yield to your desire, rather than fight it, I think you might be able to return to the matter in hand.
Aubrey: Is it that obvious? 
Booth: You're drooling like a {{w|Great Dane}}. I'll take that. [Aubrey reaches out to the plate to take a petit four] They're for me.
Dr. Wyatt: Please, gentlemen, don't fight over them. There are plenty to go 'round.
Aubrey: [looks defiantly at Booth] Plenty.
Dr. Wyatt: Share. Good children share, don't they?

Dr. Wyatt: [while helping Angela profile a suspect] I haven't had this much excitement since my last baked Alaska fiasco.

Angela: Well, it looks like a junker, like it's just a bunch of mismatched parts.
Cam: Like {{w|Frankenstein's monster}}, but the car version.

Aubrey: [after Booth makes him lead on the case] Wow, thank you, Booth. So does this mean that, like, I'm your boss now? 
Booth: Listen, Aubrey, if you have to ask if you're my boss, you're not my boss.

Linda Martin: Ronny is a creative guy, full of all these wild ideas. And after directing all the Snoozeland commercials, he decided he was ready for the real thing.
Aubrey: A real commercial? 
Linda: Movie. Said he was gonna be the next Gordon Welles. 
Aubrey: {{w|Orson Welles}}? 
Linda: Sure. Whatever, I don't know about any of that stuff. All I know is: Ronny wrote himself a story, took a leave of absence from work and went off to make his movie.
Aubrey: Huh.
Linda: This movie was all Ronny could think about. It was going to be his Citizen Crane.

Booth: The one thing I learned about these guys, these creative types, they're definitely a breed of their own.

Kirby: You guys are with "F.B.I"? I haven't heard of them. Are they new? 
Booth: [deadpan] You haven't heard of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Kirby: Oh, that FBI. (laughs) Bummer. I thought you guys were, like, Hollywood agents. Real agents.
Aubrey: We are real agents. Investigating a real murder.

Aubrey: I thought that I was supposed to be lead on the case, here.
Booth: I'm just trying to help.
Aubrey: Appreciate that, but you keep telling me where to go, what leads to follow, wouldn't even let me drive to the movie location.
Booth: You're like a turtle behind the wheel. You're like−−
Aubrey: What? 
Booth: [grits his teeth in frustration] A turtle. We would've still been in the parking lot if you were driving, Aubrey.
Aubrey: We would've got there. That's my point. You know, you got to let me work my own pace, here.
Booth: Fine.

Brennan: How important do you think it is for us to love what we do? 
Angela: Uh, well, it, it's important, but it's not everything. Most people don't love their jobs. They don't even like them. They do them because they have to.
Brennan: What if they didn't have to? 
Angela: If you can afford to leave an unfulfilling job, why wouldn't you?

Zack: No, I've had many years to study courtroom procedure. I am ready.

Caroline: Is a fierce vision by the name of Caroline Julian? Is that what you were going to say, Cher? [glares at Brennan]
Brennan: No.
