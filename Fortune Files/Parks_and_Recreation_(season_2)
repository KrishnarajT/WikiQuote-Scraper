Joan Callamezzo: Miss Knope, how do you respond?
Leslie: I'd first like to say that I wasn't trying to advocate for anyone. I did not know that both of the penguins were males, and I was just trying to perform a cute, fun ceremony to promote our local zoo.
Joan Callamezzo: I have to say that that stunt that you did with the penguins was clearly over the line. Now, Marcia, what, if anything, can Miss Knope do to make it right? 
Marcia: Now Joan we don't want to be unreasonable. 
Joan Callamezzo: Of course not.
Marcia: We think that she should separate the penguins, annul the marriage, reimburse the taxpayers for the cost of the wedding, of course, and then resign.
