Meredith: [voice over] The painful irony for doctors, is that we often have to make you sicker in order to heal you. If a bone has unevenly, we have to re-break it. If a scar is too thick, we have to scrape it off, and create a new wound. We break you down to rebuild you.

Meredith: [voice over] We go to medical school because we want to learn how to fix what’s broken. But we quickly learn we have to make things worse before we make things better. It’s risky, and it’s frightening for surgeons, and for patients, but it’s usually worth it. You get a second chance at life, and we get to be the architects at your second chance. It’s a win-win… when it works.

Meredith: [voice over]: There’s a saying we hear a lot around hospitals… that goes like this – “Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.” But I doubt the person who coined it ever went through major surgery. Or maybe they didn’t mean physical pain. Maybe they meant the other kind, the worse kind. Maybe they meant the kind of searing, seething, boiling pain that tells you you’re a failure and a fraud. “Suffering is optional.” That person didn’t know what the…they were talking about.

When Hunt became chief, he did not have to squeeze five toes into a space built for two. But I became chief and I can’t wear my perfectly comfortable surgical clogs anymore. Any you know why?
Ben: Society?
Bailey: S...Society.
Meredith: [voice over] As surgeons, we try to eliminate pain. As humans, we just try like hell to avoid it. When we can’t avoid pain, we try to understand it… with pithy little quotes that we can wrap our head around…  like “Suffering is optional,” or “Time heals all wounds,” and my personal favorite,   “Every pain has a purpose.” God, I hope that one’s true.
