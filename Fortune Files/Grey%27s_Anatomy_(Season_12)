Arizona: Okay, that's... that's just...
Stephanie: You have screwed dozens of interns, and you got them all fired. You speak really fast, like superhuman fast. You have a weird name.
Arizona: You know, that's not true. That's not true. I only slept with one intern, and I have an awesome name! I mean, like what man, what? What else? I mean what do people have a problem with the fact that I have one leg. I mean, do people actually go there and talk crap about a one-legged woman? Because that is just discrimination against amputees.
Stephanie: They say you have two legs and you are only pretending one is amputated. For the parking space.

What's changed? My answer is you. The thing's that changed is you. I want you to throw everything you think you know about anatomy out the window and look at this cadaver like you've never seen a human body before. Now pick up your scalpels, place them below the xiphoid process, press firmly, no regrets, and let's begin.

Webber: I mean, if you do not value her enough, then just--
Bailey: It is inappropriate for me to discuss the salary of another employee.
Webber: She deserves more, and you know it.
Bailey: I do, and don't ever suggest to me that I do not stand in sisterhood with other women in this hospital. You've never been 4'11" tall and overlooked and called 'girl' by your male colleagues. You don't know. I am woman. Hear me roar. But I've already mentored Grey. I've already taught her what she needs to know. And now that I'm chief of this hospital, it's not my fault if she's not used the skills that I taught her. And it's not my job to be giving away money when it's not asked for. You have coddled her. Y--Y-- Since Derek, you have coddled her, and I won't do that. No, she needs to rise. And she needs to rise on her own so she knows she can rise on her own. Because... You may not be here the next time she falls. She needs to fight for herself.
Webber: Okay.

Owen: When the plane crashed, when I heard Cristina's plane had crashed, my first thought was that she was dead, and for a moment, I felt relieved. And for a moment... I felt relieved. I felt terrible for feeling it, but it was there. And I always knew on some level she'd leave me, and I wasn't ready to be hurt like that. So if she was dead, we would stay frozen in time forever. And she'd be gone, but it wouldn't be so hard. It wouldn't be a choice, to walk away, to choose something else, to move to Switzerland and start another life. I was relieved that it was over with a minimum of damage, and I hate myself for that. So I am not perfect, Amelia. I can be selfish, and I can be scared, and I make things harder than I need to. I know I do. I make things hard for us.

Meredith: [opening voice-over] In group settings, men are 75% more likely to speak up than women. And when a woman does speak up, it's statistically probable her male counterparts will either interrupt her, or speak over her. It's not because they're rude, it's science. The female voice is scientifically proven to be more difficult for a male brain to register. What does this mean? It means, in this world, where men are bigger, stronger, faster, if you're not ready to fight, the silence will kill you.

Webber: [to Meredith] She [Amelia] came to see you the night after the attack. She was drunk. She was upset because you called her for a consult that day, the day of the attack, and she the choice between coming to you and going to another trauma. She went to the other trauma because she was mad at you. Forgiveness is a powerful thing, Meredith. Not only to make the other person feel good, but to heal you. You need to forgive her, Meredith. Forgive her for not being Derek. For being the wrong Shepherd. Just enough to remind you of what's missing, but not enough to bring him back. That's not her fault. You need to forgive her. You don't have to like her. You don't have to love her. Look, forgive her, okay? So you can forgive Blake for being in that room when a wrong decision caused you your husband. To forgive Derek for dying too soon. To forgive yourself for hating him for dying too soon. Let it go, Meredith, and forgive.

Now you have to figure out, will they live? Will you be able to save them or are they a lost cause?

April: [closing voice-over] We talk about the mechanism of injury, about where it all started, but the truth is, it's sort of a myth. We can't boil every injury down to one single blow. What hurts us is cumulative. It happens over time. We absorb blow after blow, shock after shock, painful hit after hit. But even then, even if we know exactly how we got here, it doesn't mean we can fix it. we can't heal every wound and that's okay. I have to believe it's okay.

Meredith: [closing voice-over] Hindsight is always 20/20. It's easy to figure out what you should have done when you replay it. You see your mistakes. You know how you'd correct them. But that's the kicker, isn't it?

Meredith: [opening voice-over] Surgeons have a saying: all bleeding must stop. It's sort of our version of "this too shall pass". Every crisis will eventually come to an end. You either save your patient, or you won't. So, one way or the other, the bleeding will stop. Actually, as far as sayings go, this one's really not all that comforting.

Maggie: You don't owe me an explanation, obviously, but you're a good guy and a great surgeon, and I just... Why?
Nathan: I didn't lie to Meredith.
Maggie: It's fine. Forget it.
Nathan: Look, everything I told her was true. There was a patient. There was a helicopter. I just left some parts out. The part where we fought... where I cheated... where I failed the best person I've ever met, the only woman I've ever loved. And those parts are for me and Megan. You're right. I don't owe anyone that. I made a mistake, a big one. And I've paid for it ever since.

Jackson: All right, I have been going over the paperwork, you know, for the lawyer. The prenup, post-nup, whatever.
April: You know, I just... I don't need this.
Jackson: At first glance, it was actually really frustrating, you know, 'cause I wasn't finding anything that was actually gonna help my case. It was just so fair. Um, and I realized that was because it was written by two people who really loved each other, two people who really wanted to protect each other, who really wanted what was best for each other. And, April, I, uh... I don't know where those people went. I don't know if we can fix us, April. I don't know if we should. But I know I don't like who I am turning into. I don't want to treat you... This person who wrote this, who signed this, was your best friend. You were my best friend, April, my favorite person. And I realized that that's who I should be dealing with. We should treat each other the way we did on this paper.

Meredith: [closing voice-over] All bleeding must stop. Sometimes, it does so at a cost. You lose the arm, remove the organ. You choose to live with the loss, because at the end of the day, you'll do whatever you can to stay alive. And sometimes, by some miracle, it works. The bleeding stops. But sometimes, now matter how hard you try, it's still not enough.

Meredith: [opening voice-over] Surgeons are often evaluated on speed and efficiency, but that doesn't mean faster is always better. You jump the gun, you risk making the wrong diagnosis. We don't always have the time to think before we act and that's what gets us in trouble.

Maggie: S-E-X with DeLuca.
Zola: Hey, Mommy.
Meredith: Yes?
Zola:  Why did Aunt Maggie stop having S-E-X with DeLuca?
Meredith: Because he couldn't handle that she was his B-O-S-S. Do not ever date a man who can't handle your P-O-W-E-R.

Arizona: I just want to lie down. I should, because I'm gonna lose this fight. I'm putting up a losing fight. This is just gonna hurt Sofia and it's going to end with me losing my little girl anyway, because that woman is watching me be a terrible doctor and a terrible mother. Maybe I am? Today, I feel like both.
Webber: If you want your daughter, you're going to have to fight like you've never fought before. You are going to have to stand up for yourself and believe you deserve it. You want to lie down? You don't get to.

Amelia: You don't just meet your perfect match and everything is beautiful and perfect. That's not how life works, and if anyone should understand that, it's you and me.
Owen: I'm having trouble understanding you now.
Amelia: Oh, stick with me. Okay, I create these obstacles out of dead people and drugs that I may or may not do, and sisters-in-law and I know I make this tough, it feels like work. Cause it's going to be work. If you and I move forward together, it is harder to... It's harder to love somebody than to walk away from them. And this is... This would be... And, oh, geez, this is messy and scary. God, Owen, it just scares the life out of me.
Owen: I'm scared, too. If you and I decide to be together, really together, I will wind up screwing all of this up.
Amelia: Me too! That is how - I screw everything up, all the time!
Owen: Let's screw some things up.

Meredith: [closing voice-over] The thing about being on a team is, it's a commitment. You have to bring it. You have to help with the win, no matter what. You may not always like your teammates. You have to learn to share the ball. You have to be all-in, one side or the other. But if you play hard, give it your all, really commit, victory is that much sweeter.

Meredith: [opening voice-over] There's this Bible story. Two women both claim to be the mother of the same child. King Solomon had to choose. Two mothers, only one gets the kid. Solomon came up with a plan. He proposed a 50/50 split. Literally. He offered to chop the kid in half. It all ends if one mom relinquishes her custody, or else they both stand their ground, and the kid gets torn apart.

Lucinda: Callie drops Sofia off at your place sometimes when she has to work or when she has plans or when she needs a night off. Correct?
Meredith: A "night off"? Being a mom isn't a job. We don't punch in and punch out. There are no nights off. We are both single parents. That's not a dirty word. But we do need help getting our kids to where they need to be with all of their limbs intact. So we lean on each other. That's not a sign of weakness or bad parenting, if that's where you're going with this. It takes a village, and we have a village.
Lucinda: Here in Seattle.
Meredith: What?
Lucinda: The village you just mentioned, the seamless support system these mothers built, this essential network. It's all here in Seattle. Sofia's friends and her school, her teachers. Her home is here in Seattle. That's what Sofia would be leaving.

Michelle: Just to be clear, Dr. Sloan and Dr. Torres were Sofia's parents and then you came around.
Arizona: No, I didn't "come around." I'm Sofia's mother. I legally adopted her.
Michelle: Her last names are Sloan and Torres.
Arizona: I'm gonna have to stop you before you continue for your own sake. You're not going to imply that I'm any less Sofia's mother because we don't share the same DNA. Because that would be offensive. It would be offensive to anyone in the room who has an adopted child or is an adopted child, and for you to say that. I chose to be Sofia's mother! It did not fall into my lap. There was a choice, and I could stay or I could run, and I chose motherhood. And it was the best choice that I ever made.

Meredith: [opening voice-over] Infections have a nasty way of sneaking up on you. You're feeling pretty good, you think the infection is gone, and then, it reappears, out of nowhere. When your body's still weak, when you're barely recovered, BAM! You're infected all over again. And once the infection spreads, once it gets into your bloodstream, well, then you really have to watch it, cause that's the kind of infection that can kill you.

And it sure as hell doesn't mean you get to crap on everyone else. And yeah, I'm gonna have a big wedding and you're gonna be there 'cause you're gonna be my best man. Deal with it!

Arizona: We already did move things around. Or rather, I already moved things around for you.

Arizona: With bending the rules for your convenience? The rules that only exist because you put us and all of our friends through hell? No. I'm sorry. I just... You know, you chose this. You ruined everything. And yet you still expect me to leap to fulfill your needs. But I did that. I did that this morning.
Callie: Okay, Arizona, I get it. You're angry.
Arizona: I wasn't angry. I was gracious. I was nice and I was accommodating and I tried to help you, and yet here you are again, asking for even more. I do not have any more to give you. You have used up all of my grace.

Alex: No, I'm ready to be married, and I need to know when you will be ready. It doesn't have to be today or tomorrow, but I need to know it's gonna happen.

Now you think, what, you're my sun and my moon, that all of a sudden I think that the stars shine down on only you, that you touched me and the heavens opened and I'm blinded by the angel that is you?

Amelia: Meredith, I am flipping out here. I'm wearing a wedding gown. There is a good and decent man in there who loves me and is expecting to marry me, and I can't tell if I am marrying because I love him back or because I just ran here and picked up a scalpel and slipped into this Shepherd skin. And maybe it is right, and maybe it's not, but I don't know, and I am marrying Cristina's husband. I know what you think about that. And I don't know what I'm doing. And there is no one here with me. There is no one here to tell me to quit or get me down the aisle or help me. That is Derek's job, and Derek is dead. And all I have is Maggie, and Maggie is full of sunshine and candy and hope, and every time I try to tell her that the world is on fire, she hands me a marshmallow to roast, so that just leaves you. And you... you are rooting for the other guy. You told me to go and be with Owen, and then you turned on me, and now you are not on my side. And we both know you don't like me, but you are stuck with me. So here I am in a wedding gown on the happiest fricking day of my life in a room with no family and no help and no one on my side but you. So what can you do for me? What can you do for me, Meredith?
Meredith: You're me.
Amelia: What?
Meredith: You're me before Derek. I can be here for you. I know how to do this. I can be a twisted sister for you. Just how do you want to play this? Do you need me to tell you you're a beautiful bride and kick your ass down that aisle? You're a beautiful bride. Turn around. I'll start kicking. Do you need me to call your mother and yell at her? I'm your girl. If you need a shoulder to cry on, I have two. If you want to freak out and call it off, if you want to run, I'll drive the getaway car. Just let me know what you need. I'm here for you. I am your family, Amelia. Today, I am your person. Just tell me what you want to do.
