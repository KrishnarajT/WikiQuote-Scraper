Meredith: [voice over] There is a portion of the cerebral cortex of your brain, folded deep within an area between the temporal and frontal lobes. It's called the insula, and it's where desire starts. The insula is only about the size of a pea,but what it triggers in our bodies and, by extension, in our lives,can be epic.

Meredith: [voice over] We'd like to imagine that we're in control. But more often than not...the chemicals in our brains control us. The insula lights up,and we are compelled to change our lives. Compelled by longing. Compelled by yearning. Compelled by desire for more.

Meredith: [voice over] Just like we need food and water, humans need each other. A brain study revealed that, when placed in an MRI,a patient's reward center lit up when another person sat in the room. Neurons fire when we talk to someone, think about someone,and they go haywire when we hold someone's hand. Our brains and bodies are actually programmed to seek each other out and connect. So, then why do so many people prefer being alone?

Meredith: [voice over] Why do we often run for the hills when we feel the slightest connection? Why do we feel compelled to fight what we're hard-wired to do? Maybe it's because when we find something or someone to hold onto,that feeling becomes like air...and we're terrified we're going to lose it. And trust me,you can get pretty good at the along thing. But most things are better when they're shared with someone else.

Meredith: [Voice Over] In the early days of medicine, surgical students would perfect their sewing technique on tree branches. Because looking at an exposed bone in an amputation, human instinct is to recoil, not cut. They needed students to get out of the habit of listening to instinct. A lot of our training is breaking instinct. Developing new habits. Don't react to bad news in front of patients. Don't show fear when faced with uncertainty. When you are looking at that exposed bone, CUT. So the trick is trying to stay human when we have shut down all those gut feelings, all those messy instincts. "

Meredith: [Voice Over] So what about those times when there is no road map? Should we go with our gut then? If instinct is all we have, it's not always a bad thing. It can bring us wonderful places. Joyful places. And it can also serve an important purpose. Because our gut is usually what warns us when trouble lies ahead.

Meredith: [Voice Over] When I was little I once asked my mother, how do you tell people such bad news? You tell them the truth, she said. But you tell them the best version of the truth you can come up with. My mother also never told me I had a little sister, so... grain of salt. "

Meredith: [Voice Over] My mother said, tell the truth! Just tell the best version of the truth you can. Because the truth is going to come out some time. And the one thing you can't do with the truth, is hide from it. Because the truth is gonna come looking. Until it finds you. "

Meredith: [Voice Over] Everyday we're surrounded by people who ask how we're doing. But when surgeons ask how you're doing, we generally care about your answer. Your answer to "How are you doing?" Tells us how good of a job we're doing at taking care of you. Unfortunately, caretaking outside of medicine is usually more complicated.  "

Meredith: [Voice Over] Surgeons are trained to provide care for others. Some biologists believe it's human nature, the desire to help. Scientists believe we're biologically programmed to empathize. I think it's one of the reasons our species has lasted this long. We have an innate instinct to support each other. You can only take care of yourself for so long. Because lets face it, some problems are way too big to carry on our own. "

Meredith: [Voice Over] The poet Octavio Paz once wrote, the Mexican is familiar with death. Jokes about it, caresses it, sleeps with it, celebrates it. I can relate. But in a hospital, death isn't celebrated. It's avoided at all costs. And when it comes, it's clinical, almost routine. But still with all that practice. Even surgeons are surprised by death. Especially when it happens to the ones we love.   "

Meredith: [Voice Over] Every religion, every country, every culture. Death means something to all of us. We all have different ideas about how to honour the dead. Different ideas on how to grieve. Different ways of moving on. Well, I may not be an expert, but I do have some experience with losing people I love. And I say, that right way to grieve. Is however the hell you want!  "

Meredith: [Opening Voice Over] Time is a strange thing. When you're waiting for something good to happen, it can feel like time is dragging on. But when you want it to slow down, it goes by in the blink of an eye. The off part is time isn't real. It's concept imagined by scientists based on the imperfect movement of the earth around the sun. So why do we put so much importance on something that's just a theory? Because it's all we have.
Meredith: 
[Reading Vows] "Garrett, the moment I met you, I knew I would spend the rest of my life with you. Before you, I never met anyone I could be in the same room with longer than a few hours.  I waited my whole life to meet you. I gave up thinking I ever would. But here we are. Better late than never, right? Now that I found you, it all makes sense. Everything that was once hard feels easy now that you are in my life. And everything that was once easy is now sublime.
Meredith: [Ending Voice Over] there's never enough time. Work, kids, life, death. Something always cuts our time short. So our best bet is to make the most of the time we have. Or make up for lost time. But sometimes, if we're really lucky ...time stand still.

Meredith (voice over): There is an invisible line in the OR - you scrub, you gown, you glove, and you approach the sterile field. It is an important boundary. It's there to protect the patient and you. Without that line about a million things can go wrong. Funny that something so important is completely invisible. 
Meredith (voice over): There is a reason so many babies' first word is "NO". It's because it's the word they hear the most. From the second we are born, we want to cross the line, push the boundaries, test the limits. But then we grow up and learn that not all rules are bad. Some boundaries protect us, some lines keep us safe. But the nice thing is that we can choose for ourselves - we can screw the rules or we can make our own.

Meredith (voice over): All diseases have a genetic component. But of course, genes are not always to blame. In diagnosing a disease, physicians must take into account other factors - their environment, their lifestyle. However, some genetic traits are, annoyingly, unavoidable. 
Meredith (voice over): Blood is thicker than water. It means the family you're born into is important above all else, right? Wrong. The original proverb goes a little differently. It actually says, " The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb". Meaning the bloodshed on the proverbial battlefield bonds us more than simple genetics. And, yes, DNA matters when it comes to medical history. Family is family.

Meredith (voice-over): When there is a poisonous snake on our path, we freeze. When we smell smoke, we run. When faced with danger, fear takes over, and we react desperate to feel safe. But for someone who suffers from trauma, it's the everyday things - a song in a coffee shop, the smell of rubbing alcohol - seemingly random, common things convincing your brain and body you're in danger and there is no way out  
Meredith (voice-over): Too often, trauma gets dismissed as "just in our head". But the pain is real. We feel it in our muscles, our cells, our hearts, our heads. And while there is no magic fix, no pill to make it disappear, we can ask for help. And we can tell our truth whenever we are ready.

Meredith (voice-over): If the option, we prep our surgery for days - we study, we practice, we run through it over and over again in our minds. Taking on a patient's case is not unlike a marriage. We get to know you inside and out. You trust us with your lives and we promise to protect and care for you. In sickness and health. For better or worse.
Meredith (voice-over): "In sickness and in health", they say. That sounds so final, so binding. But it just means you have to be there. You have to really want to be there for whatever is coming. And we don't know - it could be all pan out the way we want, the way it's supposed to be or it could be so much worse.

Meredith (voice over) Here's a partial list of chemicals that our bodies produce when we're falling in love. P.E.A. is a natural form of amphetamine. It puts us on high alert. Pheromones, produced from DHEA, create an inexplicable sense of well-being and comfort. Oxytocin has been called "the cuddle hormone", and it stimulates the secretin of dopamine, estrogen, and LHRH. This cascade of feel-good hormones and neurotransmitters is also generally accompanied by poor judgment. No wonder they call it "crazy in love". 
Meredith (voice over): When we're in love, the prefrontal cortex, where we make most of our good, rational decisions, goes into sleep mode. And the amygdala, which activates our threat response defenses, calls in sick, which leaves us pretty vulnerable to take more risk. And left alone without our normal neurological protections, we might find ourselves in dangerous and unexpected places we normally wouldn't dream of going.
