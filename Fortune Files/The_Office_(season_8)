Robert: Here's what it is, it's a doodle. Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised, don't you think?

Andy: If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens. Like we block Minesweeper. 
Dwight: Or in this case an e-mail gets sent to Robert California containing the consultant's report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shut down?  And as a failsafe, every negative e-mail you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
Andy: What e-mails are you talking about? 
Dwight: "Robert's favorite songs: 'Creep' by TLC, 'Creep' by Radiohead." Remember that one, Jim? "There's no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper." Oscar. "He eats his yogurt like he's punishing it for disappointing him." Kelly. 
Andy: That's not that bad actually. 
Dwight: "PS: We should kill him."

Pam: Dwight, am I hot right now? 
Dwight: Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now?  I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
Pam: What about before?  Was I attractive before? 
Dwight: Meh.  You were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time.  Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.

Andy: Y-you...wait, you mean you wish she wasn't here or something?
Erin: I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground.  With worms coming out of her mouth.
Andy: Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK?  That's my girlfriend that you're talking about.  You and I are not together anymore.  You need to get over it! Take your wish back.
Erin: Too late!  It's already been wished!  And you promised it would come true.  You wrote it in an email!  So, which one are you?  A murderer or a liar?

Gabe: Yeah.  But not just bagels.  All unwanted problems.  Question: What's the most important appliance in your house? 
Dwight: Meat grinder.
Gabe: [makes buzzer sound] Too slow.  It's the toilet.  And I am the toilet of this office.  I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean.  And, just like a toilet, I am essential. 
Dwight: You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator, or eraser, and instead you chose toilet.  God bless you. You're an American classic.
