Leslie: No, not really.  I know I should be focusing on this cleanup, but all I think about is Ben laughing in a helicopter with Hot Rebecca. 
Andy: Who's Hot Rebecca?
Leslie: She's just this jealousy amalgam I created.  [Andy stares confused] I combined all of the giant dark-haired smartphone power goddesses into one woman called Hot Rebecca.
Andy: Oooh.
Leslie: I mean Ben's life is filled with senators and briefings and Super PACs.  I can't even get a meeting with some bureaucrat.
Andy: [laughing] I don't even know what a bureaucrat is.  Everything is gonna be fine with you and Ben because if I know Ben, he too is an amalgam.
Leslie: No.
Andy: Yeah.  Point is you're better than Hot Rebecca.  You're Kickass Leslie.  Long distance relationships are never easy but you never ever give up on stuff.

Ben: [tying his bow-tie] Okay, did I- did I do it right? [the tie is crooked] How's it look? 
Chris: Terrible. And perfect. I promised myself I was not going to cry tonight. And I have already broken that promise five times. But I will not... break it a sixth. 
Ben: Go ahead and let it out, buddy. It's okay. 
Chris: I have something for you. 
Ben: All right. 
Chris: It is the letter from the statehouse... telling us that we have been assigned to Pawnee. Dated May 1st, 2010. 
Ben: [quietly] No way.
Chris: We were supposed to be here eight weeks. I'm so happy that those eight weeks turned into three years, and that you met Leslie, and that we both found a home. 
Ben: Damn it, you're transferring your crying thing over to me. 
Chris: It's okay, buddy, let it out. [they laugh]

Ron On the night I punched Councilman Jamm in the face, I warned him several times to back off, and instead he attacked me twice. Truthfully, I barely registered his attack. He's incredibly frail and his arms are weak. And when I punched him, he dropped so quickly I thought he was diving towards the ground. I regret nothing. The end.

April: [smiles] Really? Thanks.

Ron: Normally, if given a choice between doing something and nothing, I'd choose to do nothing. But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing. I'd work all night if it meant nothing got done.

Ann I keep getting outbid by someone called Tall Tyrion Lannister. What kind of name is that?
Donna Are you kidding me? Tyrion Lannister? Lord of Casterly Rock? The half man? You don't watch Game of Thrones?
Ann No, do you?
Donna Hell, yeah! Have you seen those Dothraki dudes? They can get it! Everyone on that show can get it!

Ann: Stop bidding on my waffle iron.
Ben: You're futuremrstigerwoods? 
Ann: I made that profile, like, ten years ago. I don't know how to change it. The point is I'm getting that waffle iron for Leslie for Breakfast Day. 
Ben: Uh, no, you're not. I'm getting it for her for Waffle Day. Wait, you have a breakfast day too? Mine's in June.
Ann: Please, Ben. This is the celebration of the anniversary of the first time we hung out at JJ's, which she considers the beginning of our friendship. 
Ben: Well, imagine being married to her. It's like being smothered with a hand-quilted pillow filled with cherished memories. I can't believe I'm complaining about how thoughtful my wife is. [loud to the room] Sorry, honey. I love you. 
Ann: Look, I have known her for longer, I have five years' worth of anniversaries, so I have seniority. 
Ben: Oh, god. Oh, no! We've lost the auction. 
Ann: What- no!
Ben: Somebody swooped in at the last second, and now we're both screwed. 
Ann: No! Okay, Tyrion Lannister, why don't you just cast a spell and get us the waffle iron back?
Ben: Oh, okay. I don't even have time to tell you how wrong you are. [pause] Actually, it's gonna bug me if I don't. The Lannisters while very wealthy, do not possess the magical abilities of, say, the warlocks of Qarth for example.
Ann: This is why we don't hang out.
