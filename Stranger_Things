Hopper: Well, congratulations. You just graduated from no TV for a month, to no TV at all!
[He rips the power cord in two]
Eleven: NO! No, no... no! [she tries to fix it]
Hopper:  You have got to understand that there are consequences to your actions-
Eleven: YOU are like Papa!
Hopper: [hurt and furious] Really? I'm like that psychotic son of a bitch? Well, all right. You wanna go back in the lab? One phone call, I can make that happen.
Eleven: I hate you!
Hopper: Yeah, well I'm not so crazy about you, either. Know why? 'Cause you're a brat. You know what that word means? How 'bout that be your word for the day, huh? Brat: why don't we look it up?  B-R-A-T. Brat.

Scott Clarke: All living things, from complex mammals to single-celled organisms, instinctively respond to danger. Expose a bacterium to a toxic chemical and it will flee, or deploy some other defense mechanism. We're very much the same. When we encounter danger, our hearts start pounding. Our palms start to sweat. These are the signs of the physical and emotional state we call... "fear."

Sam Owens: "Men of science have made abundant mistakes of every kind." [[George Sarton said that. You guys know who George Sarton is?  Doesn't really matter. The point is, mistakes have been made, yes.
Nancy: "Mistakes?!"
Sam Owens: Yes.
Nancy: You killed Barbara!
Sam Owens: "Abundant mistakes".  But, the men involved in those mistakes, the ones responsible for what happened to your brother and... Ms. Holland's death, they're gone. They're gone, and for better or for worse, I'm the schmuck they brought in to make things better. But I can't make things better without your help.
Nancy: You mean, without us shutting up?
Sam Owens: [to Jonathan, indicating Nancy] She's tough, this one. You guys been together long?
Jonathan: We're not together.
Sam Owens: Wanna see what really killed your friend?
[They enter the chamber holding the portal to the Upside Down]
Sam Owens: Teddy, I brought you an audience today. Hope you don't mind.
Teddy: The more the merrier, sir.
Sam Owens: [gestures at the  tendrils coming out of the portal] I call it, "One Hell of a Mistake." Wouldn't you? See, the thing is, we can't seem to... erase our mistake. But we can stop it from spreading. It's like pulling weeds. But, imagine for a moment, if a foreign state, let's say, the Soviets, if they heard about our mistake. Do you think they would even consider that a mistake? What if they tried to replicate that?  
[A man with a protective suit and a flamethrower approaches the portal]
Sam Owens: The more attention we draw to ourselves, the more... the more people like the Hollands know the truth, the more likely that scenario becomes. You see why I have to stop the truth from spreading, too... same as those weeds, there. By whatever means necessary.

Nancy: [skeptically] How long is this gonna take?
Murray Bauman: Longer, if you keep talking.
Nancy: Is the tape incriminating or not?! It's a simple question.
Murray Bauman: Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! [turns around] There's nothing simple about it, nothing simple about anything you've told me!
Jonathan: You don't believe us, do you?
Murray Bauman:  I believe you, but that's not the problem. You don't need me to believe you, you need them to believe you.
Jonathan: "Them?"
Murray Bauman: "Them."  With a capitol T. [waves at his various TV sets] Your priest, your postman, your teacher, the world at large. [scoffs] They won't believe any of this.
Nancy: That's why we made the tape!
Murray Bauman: Oh, that's easy to bury.  Easy!
Nancy: He admits it!  You heard it, he admits culpability!
Murray Bauman: You're being naive, Nancy!  Those people... they're not wired like me and you, okay?  They don't spend their lives trying to get a look at what's behind the curtain. [chuckles] They like the curtain.  It provides them stability, comfort, definition. This... this would open the curtain, and open the curtain behind that curtain, okay? So the minute someone with an ounce of authority calls "bullshit", everyone will nod their heads and say, "See? Ha! I knew it! It was bullshit!" That is, if you even get their attention at all!

And you drew this big spaceship, but it wasn't from a movie, it-it was your spaceship. A "rainbow ship" is what you called it. And you, you must have used every color in the box. I... I took that with me to Melvald's, and I put it up, and I told everyone who came in, "My son drew this." And you were so embarrassed. [chuckles tearfully] But I was so proud. I was so, so proud.

Hopper: Oh, I don't know. I'm just curious why, all of a sudden, you look like some kinda MTV punk? [pause] I'm not mad, kid. I just wanna know where you've been. That's all.
Jane Ives/Eleven: To see Mama.
Hopper: Okay. How'd you get there?
Jane Ives/Eleven: A truck.
Hopper: "A truck?"
Jane Ives/Eleven: A big truck.
Hopper: "A big truck?" Whose truck was it?
Jane Ives/Eleven: A man's.
Hopper: A man's?
Jane Ives/Eleven: A nice man.
Hopper: Okay. So, let me just get this straight in my head: so, a nice man in a big truck, he drove you to your mama's? And then what, your- your aunt Becky gave you those clothes and that makeup?!
Jane Ives/Eleven: I... I shouldn't have left.
Hopper: Hmm-mm, No. No, this isn't on you, kid. I should've been there. I should never have lied to you about your mom... or about when you could leave. A lot of things I shouldn't have done. Sometimes, I feel like I'm... like I'm just some kinda black hole or something.
Jane Ives/Eleven: "Black hole?"
Hopper: Yeah, it's a... y'know, it's this thing in outer space. It's like... it sucks everything towards it and destroys it. Sarah had a picture book about outer space, she loved it.
Jane Ives/Eleven: Who's Sarah?
Hopper: Sarah? Sarah's my girl. [looks at her] She's my little girl.
Jane Ives/Eleven: Where is she?
Hopper: Well, that's kinda the thing, kid. She, uh... well, she left us.
Jane Ives/Eleven: Gone.
Hopper: Yeah. The black hole. It got her. And, somehow... I've just been scared, you know. I've just been scared that it would take you, too. I guess that's why I get... so mad. [shakes his head] I'm so sorry. For everything. I can be so... so...
Jane Ives/Eleven: Stupid.
Hopper: [chuckles] Yeah... stupid. Just really stupid.  
[Eleven squeezes his hand]
Jane Ives/Eleven: I've been stupid, too.
Hopper: I guess we broke our rule. [Eleven smiles tearfully] I don't hate it, by the way. This whole... look. Kinda cool.

Hopper: [to Mike and Eleven] There's something I've been wanting to talk to you both about - and I know this is a difficult conversation. But I care about you both very much. And I know you care about each other very much and that's why it's important that we set these boundaries moving forward so we can build an environment, where we ALL feel comfortable, trusted and open to sharing our feelings. Feelings. Jesus. The truth is, for so long, I'd forgotten what those even were. I've been stuck in one place - in a cave, you might say. A deep dark cave. And then, I left some Eggos out in the woods and you came into my life and... for the first time in a long time, I started to feel things again. I started to feel happy. But lately, I guess I've been feeling... distant from you. Like you're pulling away from me or something. I miss playing board games every night, making triple-decker Eggo extravaganzas at sunrise, watching westerns together before we doze off. But I know you're getting older, growing, changing. And I guess... if i'm being really honest, that's what scares me. I don't want things to change. So I think maybe that's why I came here, to try to maybe... stop that change. To turn back the clock. To make things go back to how they were. But I know that's naive. It's just... not how life works. It's moving. Always moving whether you like it or not. And yeah, sometimes it's painful. Sometimes it's sad and sometimes it's surprising. Happy. So you know what? Keep on growing up, kid. Don't let me stop you. Make mistakes, learn from 'em, and when life hurts you - because it will - remember the hurt. The hurt is good. It means you're out of that cave. But, please, if you don't mind, for the sake of your poor old dad, keep the door open three inches.

Max: Dear Billy, I don't know if you can even hear this. Two years ago, I would have said, "That's ridiculous, impossible." But that was before I found out about alternate dimensions and monsters, so... I'm just going to stop assuming that I know anything. So much has happened since you left. Your dad was a total mess. He and my mom started getting into fights. Bad fights. I don't think he could stand being here without you. So he left. And he didn't leave Mom much. She's taken an extra job, and we moved to that lovely trailer park off Kerley. Basically, ever since you left, everything's been... a total disaster. And the worst part is, I can't tell anyone why you're gone. I can't tell them that you saved El's life. That you saved my life. I play that moment back in my head all the time. And sometimes I imagine myself running to you, pulling you away. I imagine that if I had, that you would still be here. And everything would be... everything would be right again. I imagine that we... that we could've become friends. Good friends, like... like a real brother and sister. And I know that's stupid. You hated me. I hated you. But I thought that maybe... maybe we could try again. But that's not what happened. I just... I stood there and I watched. For a while, I tried to be happy. Normal. But I... I think that maybe a part of me died that day too. And I haven't told anyone this. I... I just can't. But I had to tell you. Before it's too late. If you can even hear this. I really hope that you can. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry, Billy. Love, your shitty little sister, Max.

I get over there, I must test well, and they put me in the Chemical Corps. There I am. I'm just... a kid, you know. I'm 18 years old, 8,000 miles away, and I'm mixing up these... 55-gallon drums of Agent Orange. With just these kitchen gloves, you know? We used to clean out these buffalo turbines after a run and just be inhaling the stuff. No masks, nothing. "It's not chemical warfare. It's just herbicide to kill plants. Harmless." That's what they told us. And then I got back to real life, and these guys I worked with, the ones that made it back, they started trying to get back to normal, you know? Having families. And then things started going wrong. Kids born stillborn. Dead in the womb. Crooked spines, eyes popped out. The horror... followed us, clung to us. My wife Diane, she wanted a baby. I did too. We had a baby, and she was, um... She was born healthy. She was perfect, you know. Sara. And then she died. It wasn't an easy death. She... suffered. I knew the risks, but I, um... I hid them. And then Diane left me. She didn't blame me. Not with words. After that, I was just... I just hid myself in drugs and alcohol. And then people started coming into my life. This girl El, and Joyce just happened, and I told myself they needed me. But that wasn't true. That's a lie. They didn't need me. I needed them. I needed them. You were right, what you said last night. I knew the risks, breaking out of here, but I did it anyway. The minute I sent for Joyce, the minute I sent for her, I sentenced her to death. Just like I did with Sara. Everyone I love, I hurt. See, I was wrong this whole time. I wasn't cursed. I am the curse.

Robin: I mean, it's just a clock. Right? Like a normal old clock.
Steve: Why is this wizard obsessed with clocks? Maybe he's, like, a clockmaker or something?
Dustin: [sarcastic] I think you cracked the case, Steve.

One: Like you, I didn't fit in with the other children. Something was wrong with me. All the teachers and the doctors said I was... "Broken," they said. My parents thought a change of scenery, a fresh start in Hawkins, might just cure me. It was absurd. As if the world would be any different here. But then... to my surprise, our new home provided a discovery. And a new found sense of purpose. I found a nest of black widows living inside a vent. Most people fear spiders. They detest them. And yet, I found them endlessly fascinating. More than that, I found a great comfort in them. A kinship. Like me, they are solitary creatures. And deeply misunderstood. They are gods of our world. The most important of all predators. They immobilize and feed on the weak, bringing balance and order to an unstable ecosystem. But the human world was disrupting this harmony. You see, humans are a unique type of pest, multiplying and poisoning our world, all while enforcing a structure of their own. A deeply unnatural structure. Where others saw order, I saw a straitjacket. A cruel, oppressive world dictated by made-up rules. Seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades. Each life a faded, lesser copy of the one before. Wake up, eat, work, sleep, reproduce, and die! Everyone is just waiting. Waiting for it all to be over. All while performing in a silly, terrible play, day after day. I could not do that. I could not close off my mind and join in the madness. I could not pretend. And I realized I didn't have to. I could make my own rules. I could restore balance to a broken world. A predator... but for good.

Hopper: The last time I was with El, she wanted just about nothing to do with me. I was just in her way, really. I think back to the way I was with my dad at that age. I was the same way. The exact same way. I think it must be hardwired into us to reject our fathers. So we can grow and move on. Become something of our own. I hope that's what she's doing. Coming into her own.

Eddie: I didn't run away this time, right?
Dustin: No. No, no, no, no. You didn't run.
Eddie: You're gonna have to look after those little sheep for me, okay?
Dustin: No, you're gonna do that yourself!
Eddie: Nah, man. Say, "I'm gonna look after them." Say it.
Dustin: I'm... I'm gonna look after...
Eddie: Good. 'Cause I'm actually gonna graduate. I think it's my year, Henderson. I think it's finally my year. I love you, man.
Dustin: I love you too.

Dustin: [to Eddie's uncle] I wish everyone had gotten to know him. Really know him. Because they would've loved him, Mr. Munson. They would've loved him. Even in the end... he never stopped being Eddie. Despite everything. I never even saw him get mad. He could've run. He could've saved himself. But he fought. He fought and died to protect this town. This town that... hated him. He isn't just innocent... Mr. Munson, he's... he's a hero.

Mike: El? I don't know if you can hear this, but... but if you can, I want you to know I'm here, okay? I'm right here. And... I love you. El, do you hear me? I love you. I'm sorry I don't say it more. I... It's not because I'm scared of you. I'm not. I've never felt that way. Never. But I am scared that one day you'll realize you don't need me anymore. And I thought if I said how I felt, it would somehow make that day hurt more. But the truth is, El, I don't know how to live without you. I feel like my life started that day we found you in the woods. You were wearing that yellow Benny's Burgers T-shirt. And it was so big, it almost swallowed you whole. And I knew right then and there, in that moment, that I loved you. And I've loved you every day since. I love you on your good days. I love you on your bad days. I love you with your powers, I love you without your powers. I love you for exactly who you are. You're my superhero. And... I can't lose you. Okay? Do you hear me? I can't lose you. You can do anything. You can fly. You can move mountains. I believe that. I really do. But right now, you just have to fight. Okay? El. Do you hear me? You need to fight! You have to fight. Fight! FIGHT!

Vecna: All I needed was someone to open the door. And you did that for me. Without even realizing it. Didn't you? And when you did realize, you chose to resist. So I sought a means to open my own doors. I sought... your power. So, don't you see? Once again, you have freed me.
Eleven: No. You don't have to do this. You can still stop this.
Vecna: It is over, Eleven. Your friends have lost. There is nothing... nothing you can do to stop this now. Hawkins will burn and fall. And the rest of this senseless, broken world. And I will be there. I will be there to pick up the pieces when it does. And remake it into something... beautiful. There was a time when I had hoped to have you by my side. But now I just want you to watch.
